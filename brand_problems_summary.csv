Brand,Review_Count,Problem_Summary
Audi,586,"Based on the negative customer reviews provided, the most significant issues that Audi customers are facing are:

1.  **Poor Reliability:** Frequent mechanical and electrical issues requiring costly repairs are a recurring theme. Problems range from engine failures (oil consumption, timing chain, turbo) to transmission issues (CVT, hesitation), electrical problems (instrument clusters, sensors, power windows) and water leaks (radiator, sunroof).

2.  **High Maintenance and Repair Costs:** Even for routine maintenance (oil changes, brakes), costs are perceived as exorbitant. When problems arise, the combination of expensive parts and specialized labor leads to very high repair bills.

3.  **Poor Build Quality and Premature Component Wear:** Customers complain about parts failing prematurely, flimsy construction, and interior components (seats, trim, knobs, cup holders) breaking easily. This includes everything from brake wear to sunroof/shade and window malfunctions to cracking leather and peeling paint.

4.  **Unsatisfactory Customer Service (Dealership and Audi USA):** Many reviewers report a lack of support from both dealerships and Audi of America when problems arise. This includes difficulty getting warranty work approved, misdiagnosis of problems, dealerships not being able to fix a problem, rudeness, lack of empathy, and lack of communication. A pervasive theme is feeling like Audi/the dealership does not care about resolving their issues.

5.  **Electronic/Tech Issues:** The infotainment/MMI system, GPS, Bluetooth, and other electronic features are frequent sources of complaints, cited as being difficult to use, unintuitive, convoluted or outright non-functional and prone to failure."
Lexus,631,"Based on an analysis of the negative customer reviews, the most prevalent problems Lexus customers are facing are:

1.  **Poor Transmission Performance:** Hesitation, jerky shifting, and rough transitions are consistently cited, particularly at low speeds and during acceleration. Many customers reported dealers being unable to resolve or even acknowledge the issue. Some specific models with repeated transmission issues are the Lexus ES and RX.
2.  **Ride Comfort Issues:** Harsh rides, excessive road noise, and uncomfortable seats are frequently mentioned. This includes complaints about stiff suspensions, wind noise, and poor seat design leading to back pain. This issue is noticed across models from the IS to the LX.
3.  **Disappointing Technology & Infotainment:**  Navigation systems are described as outdated, unintuitive, and difficult to use, with voice recognition being unreliable. The control interfaces (joystick, mouse) are clunky and distracting, and certain features are disabled while driving. Some apps that were expected to come standard such as parking sensors or a remote starter would sometimes need subscription fees.
4.  **Quality and Reliability Concerns:** Many customers express disappointment in the reliability of newer Lexus models compared to older ones. Squeaks, rattles, engine problems, rust issues, paint chipping, and electrical malfunctions are all mentioned, suggesting a decline in overall build quality. Some models such as the IS and GX have been known to have a multitude of specific technical problems.
5.  **Poor Fuel Economy:** Many customers are very disappointed in the mpg they are receiving, which in some cases did not meet the advertised amount."
BMW,847,"After analyzing the negative customer reviews, here are the main problems BMW customers are facing:

1.  **Poor Reliability/Frequent Repairs:** This is the most dominant complaint. Customers report constant issues, especially after the warranty expires, leading to expensive repairs and leaving them stranded. Specific problems include:
    *   Engine problems (oil leaks, water pump failure, fuel pump issues, etc.)
    *   Electrical problems (sensor malfunctions, idrive issues, windows, etc.)
    *   Transmission issues (jerky shifting, complete failure)
2.  **High Maintenance Costs:** Even without major failures, the cost of routine maintenance (brakes, tires, oil changes, etc.) is seen as excessively high compared to other brands.
3.  **Disappointing Quality (Interior & Build):** Many complain about the poor quality of interior materials (cheap plastic, peeling trim, uncomfortable seats). Several reports mention the car just doesn't feel like the luxury vehicle they expected, with squeaks, rattles, and flimsy parts.
4.  **Uncomfortable Ride Quality:** A stiff suspension, combined with run-flat tires, leads to a harsh and uncomfortable ride, especially on less-than-perfect roads. The seats themselves were often reported as very uncomfortable, leading to back pain.
5.  **Dealer & BMW Customer Service Issues:** Some customers cite poor experiences with dealerships, including difficulty getting issues resolved, feeling ignored or lied to, and problems obtaining loaner cars. They also report a lack of support from BMW North America."
Mercedes-Benz,915,"Based on the provided customer reviews, here's a summary of the most common problems faced by Mercedes-Benz owners:

1.  **Poor Reliability / Frequent Repairs:** This is the most pervasive issue. Customers consistently report a high frequency of repairs, ranging from minor issues to major component failures (engines, transmissions, suspensions). Many reviews mention the car being in the shop frequently, sometimes multiple times a month.

2.  **Electrical System Problems:** A wide range of electrical issues are reported, including failing sensors, malfunctioning lights (interior and exterior), problems with the radio/navigation system, keyless entry malfunctions, window motor failures, and computer-related glitches. This is often cited as a source of frustration and expense.

3.  **High Maintenance and Repair Costs:** Parts and labor for Mercedes-Benz vehicles are frequently described as ""expensive,"" ""outrageous,"" or a ""money pit."" This contributes to a high total cost of ownership, particularly after the warranty expires. Even routine maintenance tasks can be surprisingly costly.

4.  **Poor Quality Parts:** A lot of the repairs done on Mercedes are due to bad quality parts. Some owners have complained about parts breaking so easily and not lasting long and often having to change lightbulbs and breakpads often due to low quality."
INFINITI,369,"Based on the reviews, the most frequent and concerning problems INFINITI customers face are:

1.  **Poor Reliability & Build Quality:** Numerous mentions of frequent repairs (transmissions, brakes, engine issues, electrical problems, AC/Heater issues), rattles, squeaks, trim falling off, rust, and other build quality concerns are all over the reviews. Some customers report major failures occurring at relatively low mileage. Also customer service from dealers is very poor.
2.  **Brake Problems:** This is a pervasive issue, specifically with rotors warping, excessive brake dust, and frequent brake replacements required, leading to safety concerns and high maintenance costs.
3.  **Transmission Issues:** Complaints include jerky shifting, hesitation, transmission failure, especially with CVT transmissions, and general lack of responsiveness, detracting from the driving experience.

While other issues are mentioned, these three stand out as the most prominent and consistent concerns across a range of models and years."
