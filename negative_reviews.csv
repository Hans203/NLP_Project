Audi,Price/Value,car of my dreams turns out to be a dud ive wanted this car for  years i finally purchased one after test driving all other vehicles in its class just to be sure only k miles when i purchased and was a lease return keep in mind i made sure they put new rotors and break pads on the vehicle when i purchased it i have owned this car less than one year and put k miles on it i had completed the k mile service no problem just took it in for the k service and was told it needed new brake pads and rotors along with brake fluid flush oil pressure valve replacement and of course thats on top of the  price tag for the normal maintenance at k miles all of that totalling  and i havent even owned the vehicle for a year i knew that audis were expensive to fix but did not realize the poor quality of the factory parts such as brake pads and rotors im not a crazy driver and take pride in driving my car gently only occasionally speeding and braking when needed on a side note the blue tooth is horrible and the navigation is useless after this experience i have lost faith in audi i definitely will not be purchasing one again i do not feel that this car is worth the price tagdisappointing altogether
Audi,Service/Maintenance,nice car  horrible service audi service is horriblei bought new a q tdi and a q for my wifefirst the audi dealer overfills the oil in the q causing all kinds of problems and would not fix them because the car was just out of warrantythen my coolant in the q starts leaking all over the garage and they say it wont be fixed under warranty because the leak could be caused from an outside influencei called audi america who says sorry nothing we can doÂ…i am going to relay my terrible experience on every blog i can findsuch a shame as i really loved the q and thought i could get more than k miles out of itfyi criswell in annapolis was the dealer
Audi,Design/Style,lovely vehicle but far too many issues for the price weve owned a premium plus  q for around four months and have driven it extensively in city and on highwayits a fine vehicle very comfortable and has plenty of powerhowever there are many small issues with the car that really boggle the mind at the kish price the multimedia system is frankly awful its design that feels a decade old the control dial scrolls things the opposite way from other consumer devices eg ipod and the menu system is convoluted the gps is completely useless the maps provided with the car are at least  years old and the routing is poor the gas cap cover has broken already  months in flimsy construction
Audi,Price/Value, q t premium recently purchased the q premium with what appears to be the standard option list in my area of heated seats sunroof and convenience packageonly other option was the monsoon grey paint i hate the extra charge for paint car drives like an a with better utilitygas mileage has been on the higher side i drive mainly on a parkway  with stop  go trafficdeceptively fast as you almost always feel you are going slower then the speedo indicates and quite smooth for an cuvi should have ordered a premium plus stripped for the same base price but did not want to wait  extra weeksbest description a sports sedan in cuv body
Audi,Service/Maintenance,very sorry i bought this car the q is great but ive had a very bad experience with mine and cant give it a good reviewthe skylight shattered by itself in very cold weather and the dealer told me it is a known issue with the  q in cold weatherthe dealer has had the car for a month and its still not fixedthey say the skylight has to come from germany and they cant get a correct replacement partrusnak says thell make it up to me by giving me a couple of payments but it doesnt really make up for the time losti bought the car because i wanted to drive it and so far it just hasnt worked out
Audi,Design/Style,i dont like a car that thinks its smarter then me i have owned my q for  months and  miles there has never been a time that ive driven this car that i havent gotten aggravated to no end with its stupidity let me paint a picture about their presense anti collision assistance driving down the new jersey turnpike i proceed to pass another car turn signal on drift in the left start to accelerate and bam abs is activated intent on stoping this car well needless to say i get the sign a peace from the gentleman behind and and really obnoxious horn beeping rightfully soi look like an idiot that pulled out and tried to stop  that happen twice the dealer tells me theyre aware their pre sense  is very sensitive and its for my protection really there wasnt even a car in front of me   issue number two the transmission  when i start out from a stop  the transmission has to decide what gear it supposed to be in before we go clunking and banging  ok off we go the transmission  is interested in doing one thing and thats getting into the highest gear possible before you go  feet no matter what your input is you would think being a perceived highline german car audi wouldve engineered out this unsophisticated jolting and horrible mapping of a transmission  the paddle shifters are a toy the car will override your imput whenever it feels like even in manual mode   lets talk about aceleration better yet heres an exercise if youre so inclined to test drive one on ramp simulation bring the car down to about  miles an hour now theres room to merge in consider alltraffic is doing  to  miles an hour so punch the pedel  to the floor i guarantee there will be a three second delay before that car moves pretty scary with your nose out in traffic  there are other issues but i think you get my point i would seriously think long and hard and test drive the hell out of this car if you decide to consider from experience your dealership will be no help audi corporate could care less and will send you back to the dealer telling you that all is normalall that being said i will say that once the car gets moving its comfortable its not quiet and you need to pay attention to keep it straight mine likes to continually try to drift leftagain audi tells me all is good and typical of all wheel drive cars that are front wheel drive biased wrong thanks for reading in closing save yourself some money this is not a highline car and there are much better cars out there for what you will spend for this
Audi,Service/Maintenance,fire hazard notified of a recall for my q due to fire hazard parts for repair not available until late   my dealer jack daniels told me to call audi usa audi usa told me to contact my dealer  they refuse to provide a loaner and told me to stop driving the car if a light goes on the dashboard they couldnt tell me what the light looks like also told me not to garage the car terrible company to deal with
Audi,Service/Maintenance,noisy q if you are interested in buying a audi q take it on the freeway for along test drive my vehicle front end is very noisy service adviser went on a test drive with me and he said it is the highway they will not admit that it is the noisy vehicle im sorry i bought this vehicle i will not advise anyone to purchase a audi ever
Audi,Engine/Performance,lemon like other reviewers i was very excited to have decided to buy a brand new  audi q  i did months of research and based on reliability and owner satisfaction scores in consumer reports i went with the q over a volvo xc  i am regretting that choice  i have owned the vehicle for less than  months  the night i brought it home the front drivers side turn signal stopped working  it sat in the shop for  days while they replaced both headlight assemblies  then last week with just  miles on the car the engine failed which landed me brokendown on the side of the road with my yearold grandpa on a short road trip  now the dealer said that an entire new engine has to put in the car  the dealer acts like they are doing me a favor instead of being embarrassed and apologetic for this poor quality vehicle  owning an audi has been nothing but a nightmare
Audi,Comfort/Interior,wanted to give it all s having a problem with the sport heatedventilated front seats in  q the drivers seat doesnt heat much at all dealer measured it at  degrees  the passengers goes to  still very poor the service tech at audi dealer initially said  those numbers were within spec after further discussion they agreed to bring it up with audi rep who said this is an emerging concern with audi and the engineers in germany were working on it no one will give me a timeframe on a fix which im told is just a software code update very frustrating brand new luxury vehicle should deliver what you pay for
Audi,Design/Style,i expected more i had researched the car quite a bit and really wanted to like it   disappointed
Audi,Engine/Performance, issues in first  days  days in shop with  miles we have gone through the following  sunfroof shade replaced then entire sunroof  front power windows when trying to go autoup they would sometimes go all the way down and we couldnt stop then  the dash vent had plastic debris from the vent which is not smooth but jagged they fell into the vent and rattled until we almost lost our minds  took audi  visits of  and  days to diagnose   rear led reading lights dont work properly  needed to be replaced  unbelievable  never had these issues with bmw porsche toyota or ford  i will never buy another audi
Audi,Service/Maintenance,q audi disappointed i just bought q compare to other cars it looks better  after i bought i found some problems light malfunction signed showed up it has fixed clicking noise after it start and driver side heating seatit does not get hot compare to other seats it went to the service but they can not do anything i have to pick up my car without any solution just disappointed
Audi,Comfort/Interior,audi q research all options before purchase some that should come with plus only come with prestige    front storage is poorly designed you cannot drive over  mph with one window open or the entire car will start to shake transmission takes a full second to change when switching from drive to reverse and visa versa
Audi,Comfort/Interior,my review know that there are two types of front seats normal and sport seating  the sport seating is very uncomfortable  overall i like the car
Audi,Service/Maintenance,audi q  intermittent window problem this is my brand new audi q that has an intermittent problem that occurs as followa from a complete close position i rolled down the window by a few inchesb then i rolled up the window by pulling the switch up once or hold itresult occasionally it will roll down completely as you can see from the recording i took the q to the dealer and left it there for more than  week they first said there was no problem until i demonstrated the problem and the service manager experience the problem himselfthey changed the the motor and the window seal  still they cannot fix the problem this is extremely frustrated because it is safety issue  in the winter if i roll down my window by an inch to get some fresh air then the snow plow on the opposite traffic comes with all the slush and salt and sand on the street now i want to close my window and it may roll down completely and expose me to the road hazard i was also told by the dealership that it happens with a few q in their lot this is extremely frustrated  i will update how audi addresses this problem
Audi,Engine/Performance,poor qualitdesign check the noise under the dash solenoid activation noise every time start the car and reach sped between  mils repaid the noise restart the car reach the same speed per audi it is normal prior year q does not make this noise or any q or any other
Audi,Price/Value,troubling initial quality issues on  q after major camshaft failure within  miles of ownership on one of the last  qs our car was swapped by audi for a new  q  while we agreee with what others have written about the new  q the initial quality issues that weve encountered around the steering wheel and driver side mirror are extremely disappointing  while we pointed out both issues on initial delivery of the car both have unfortunately become long drawn out issues with service and then corporate audi got involved  the driver mirror had some unexplained heavy caking on inside sides and bottom almost like paint primer that service rushed to clean which they only got about  off  then left us with the car so that they could work on it again when we brought back to replace the steering wheel that had a  slit in the leather wheel at delivery  now the led  strip on that side view mirror is popping out along with moisture seeping in and service is saying its not covered  would be interested in hearing from any other consumers with similar problem on the driver mirror and how you are resolving it as replacing an entire side view mirror is quite expensive
Audi,Price/Value,audi heaven cant go wrong
Audi,Service/Maintenance,audi q
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,bought my leased audi q the only complaint i have is the difficulty and steps to use the mmi
Audi,Comfort/Interior,is  recalls in  years enough this is my rd q and the quality is way down from previous models  recalls and a completely frozen steering column needing to be towed out of a parking lot were enough and now they make them in mexico
Audi,Comfort/Interior,q large mirrors causes driver blind spots i am leasing this car  it is my first audi  my husband loves his audi so i thought i would try one after driving a mercedes gl  for  years  it has only been  months and i hate this car my   biggest complaints  the side mirrors are huge  so big that it causes major blind spots very dangerous  i have seen many complaints of this issue online and disappointed audi has not responded to fix when you are at an intersection making a left the mirror will cause a blind spot to the cars median or island of the street you are entering i would not buy this car because of this safety issue   the sensors in the front and back of  the car  are also way to sensitive and will start to beep when are you are no where close to hitting something   so sensitive  i find them to be more of a distraction and ignore the beeps  so whats the purpose when you start tuning it out
Audi,Comfort/Interior,ride is great mmi is terrible im coming up on a year with the q  i love the ride it sits well and handles well in the snow  unfortunately the mmi system that controls the navigation and entertainment is terrible  it is not intuitive it is both on the steering wheel if you can figure out which dial to roll and has a small joystick on the console  it is way too confusing too distracting there is no touch screen and overtime i try to use it i get frustrated  the book doesnt help at all because a lot of things arent in there or arent explained clearly  the system is so bad that it colors my entire feelings about the car
Audi,Comfort/Interior,"audi q   month review  tires   flat tires in  months when i have never had a flat prior  no full size space  oem tires already discontinued after  months  i now have one tire that does not match and audi has said i need to replace all the tires if i want them to match although audi does not recommend driving with tires that do not match  audi customer service awful said it would not replace the tires then said it would i have a voicemail then said it would not actual highway mpg has been  versus posted   i care about vehicle range hence why this matters for me   rattling in the winter  constant rattles that went away when temperatures warmed up"
Audi,Engine/Performance,fun to drive electronics are a hassle this turbo suv is a blast to drive the leather wrapped steering wheel and shifter feel expensive  does great in the snow with factory tires backup camera peeps when in reverse if there is something in front of the car so not helpful too many clicks to do simple things like change the radio station or climate control overly complicated electronics i came from a lexus rx put this engine in a lexus and i would go back in a heartbeatupdate   drove over eisenhower pass in colorado and the transmission popped out of gear several times this is an automatic dealer was clueless sold car shortly after not interested in a new car that expensive giving me headaches also one random time the locked drivers door popped open while driving
Audi,Comfort/Interior,not cool in the desert the sunroof is so hot the shade doesnt stop the heat from your head and the ac does not cool the cab to comfort bad ac shame on you audi i expected better for what we paid
Audi,Service/Maintenance,brakes screech known issue with no resolution the brakes have been screeching since  miles  called audi care and representative said it is a known issue with no remedy  i will never buy or lease another audi  horrible product and response from audi  i cannot wait for my lease to ends  do not purchase or lease this vehicle
Audi,Comfort/Interior,audi q in a rain storm just got back from driving on route  in a terrible rain  and wind   storm today was another  example of why i purchased  an audi suv  it holds the road so well and just feels very safe to drive especially under bad driving conditions
Audi,Design/Style,design flaw during snow or rain when the rear hatch is opened to gain access to the rear compartment water snow dirt and salt build up in the drain channel and then run into the rear compartment ive seen the mess run over the rubber seal the dealer said they cannot do anything but maybe audi will contact me and see if the problem can be solved to date no additional contact
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,audi q front led light broken  times i am reporting review audi q  year of  because the front daylight headlight running sets problems i purchased an audi q in  it happened  times of front headlight daylight running sets broken in  months my cars current mileage is only  mile which is apparently not the led headlight quality problem which is highly possible on the electrical problems now i am waiting for audis response to see they will treat it as a lemon car case or not
Audi,Service/Maintenance,buyer beware audi q is a great vehicle as long as you do not drive under  mph i have a major transmission issue rd replacement in  months audi corporate will not stand behind their products and work with you to satisfy yourself as a consumer my vehicle has lurched and hesitated when coming to a stop causing  near accidents i have never experienced such poor customer service form a corporate and a dealer standpoint they act like it is my fault there is an issue you have been warned
Audi,Price/Value,andy d compare price offered to kkbcom
Audi,Design/Style,in pieces on the shop floor at  miles beautiful paperweight for the first four weeks i owned it timing shaft tensioner failed then second time in it was the camshaft that failed audi refused buyback saying basically too bad
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,handles poorly in towncity traffic car has a serious issue with the gearbox in startstop traffic the gear is either too low or too high unable to shift correctly jerky harsh ride in town driving fuel economy is much poorer than the stated
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,poor gas mileage beware of the ugly gas mileage  i can only get the  mpg in the city on the vehicle instant mpg calculator if i am going down hill with my foot off of the accelerator  its stupid
Audi,Engine/Performance,beware timing chain tensioner at k miles the l engine has a poorly designed timing chain tensioner which is prone to failure around k miles  and will take your engine with it  there is a class action lawsuit about the problem google it  the car also does not hold its value well  im told due to lack of reliability and sky high repair costs  that said until the timing chain failed it was fun to drive and had been pretty reliable  however at k miles when the timing chain tensioner failed the engine repair costs exceeded the blue book value of the car  years old  the navigation system was clunky it had no usb ports and poor user interface for such an expensive car
Audi,Engine/Performance,will keep till kstill excelrnt vehicle being picky the only drawback to this fine car is the computer behind the nav system steep learning curve and not easily used info input system
Audi,Price/Value,luv my q just buy it youll luv it too
Audi,Service/Maintenance,no spare and no run flats   what i loveseeing the motor shut off when going down the hillseven at mph electric only until i press down too hard  ive got two cars a hybrid  a regular q
Audi,Engine/Performance,unreliable  expect major repairs every k or so i have had several reliability issues with my  audi q over the years including  excessive oil consumption eventually leading to the replacement of engine pistons and rings which audi covered thankfully  multiple mechanical and electrical issues that have prevented the vehicle from either starting or driving requiring the vehicle to be towed multiple times along with multiple and very expensive repairs from the audi dealerships seriously it seems like every  months another random issue pops up that renders the vehicle undriveable i hold my breath each time i start it just waiting for the next warning light and fourfigure audi bill also worth mentioning that the jack is much too small for the vehicle and the spare tire is deflated note the jack slipped when i was changing the tire in  and crushed my left hand leading to a trip to the er and physical therapy it remains sore and swollen to this day
Audi,Engine/Performance,disappointed beyond belief after purchasing  audis from the same dealership i am at a loss for wordswe bought an extended warranty to  mileswe had ongoing issues with oil and at  miles the pistons were replacedat  they now tell us after all services were performed at the dealershipthere is a problem with the engine compressionthey say it is our problemwow i spent over  on a car that now will require a new engine and is over the warranty by  milesi thought audi was a premium brand that stood behind its product and appreciated a loyal customeri guess  car purchases does not count for much these daysi dont think ill be buying nor recommending audi ever again
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,t oil consumption i got this car relaying on audi brand  im very disappointed that info about excessive oil consumption in these engines was available before we are going back for refill oil every  milesthat is very annoying dealer does everything to accommodate us including free car wash they claim this if within tolerancewe see dozens of disappointed audi owners theredo your research before you buythere is more and more info online about this problem
Audi,Comfort/Interior,good looking car poor build quality and horrible service under k mi  water pump went out front brake pads need to be replaced wipers already shot i live in socal  the vehicle is garaged  i have the backseat constant rattle that audi will not fixwe were just about to drive through the desert before the water pump failurethat audi didnt warn us aboutinstead it ruined our trip  they washed our car for the inconveniencethey also deny that there is a problem with the seat rattlejust do a search on it  you will see all the problems so many are experiencingnow i have to use duct tape to muffle a rattle that audi will not fix on its k vehicle that is still under warrantythis is my second audi and my last money pit
Audi,Engine/Performance,out performs mpg estimates i am an acura mdx driver who was tired of limited leg room for the driver the q is smaller but has a longer wheel base and has removed the irritating foot pedal that played havoc with my shin bone with a simple lever on the center consolestart stop set parking brake within inches of each function the prestige styling is to my likingand performance with the l engine has exceeded my expectations in both power and mileagemy entire music library is available by simply cable connecting my ipod in the glove boxsimple lead thru on the cars  screen
Audi,Price/Value,ultimate daily driver i got this car because i am tired of suvs slowness and bad handling but i do need the utility part hp make ur right foot feels good all the time and the cars look will never get u the bad attention from copsvery well build every little details that shows great craftmanship enjoy drive it everyday every where and the good part is it does not bother me with tpms nonseat belt warning those extra annoying features well bad thing about this car is expensive to fix timing belt cost more than  also all the audivws cockpit control buttons letter ez to wear off make the car looks older try to upgrade but audi do not offer v wagon no more and q just not as sharp
Audi,Price/Value,"audi doesnt get it yet the car is really fun to drive but the front seats are not the recaros with the adjustable thigh bolster that the manual shows and there is very little thigh support the real problem is audi dealers  they never tell the whole truth when you buy the car  every deal is a oneshot relationship   until audi gets its dealers to act like human beings buying and owning an audi will be a constant source of irritation and frustration   is it worth it  with all the competing products on the market i doubt it  audi dealers are the worst i have ever encountered"
Audi,Price/Value,"overrated and overpriced i have driven this car for  milesand i am totally disappointed whilethere are many admirable features itdoes not display the powerstyledifferences over other models to justifythe extra cost i am already looking tosell this vehicle"
Audi,Price/Value,s avant  eye opener the biggest sleeper on the road  no one knows what they are dealing with until after the s taillights disappear from view  take this wagon seriously

Audi,Price/Value,car from hell i purchased the certified allroad to replace my wifes  lexus rx that had zero problems in  miles  when bought  my wife passed away from cancer and it was emotionally difficult for me to drive her car  i thought the audi would serve a dual purpose of suv for camping and nice transportation for travel to my children who live several hours away in snowy regions  i underestimated the enormous unreliability  in  miles its had problems with the suspension system very pricey the cooling system shop for  days after very frightening breakdown windshield wipers transmission electric windows airbag system trim falling off or breaking audi has been no help
Audi,Comfort/Interior,ultimate snow car i have lived in colorado ski country for  years and have driven jeeps landrovers ford explorers bmws and ugh yes even a mercedes the audi allroad with michelin snow tires is the finest handling snow car in the world really i drive from denver to leadville and to aspen every week during the winter and navigate multiple  and  foot passes all winter even during the height of three and four foot snowstorms trust me this car has saved us from serious injury at least twice however as i approach  miles im getting very nervous that my  warrantly is nearing its endonly serious problem has been the hydraulics theyve been replaced three times on warranty
Audi,Engine/Performance,be warned  this car could bankrupt you we bought this car as an suv alternative  loved the carlike driving decent performance and audi style  unfortunately the car has been dreadfully unreliable  weve lost  in depreciation in  miles and had over  of warantee repair work done  thats  to drive  miles wow  the list of repairs covered by audi but inconvenient to say the least is too long to fit here  replacement transmissions new brake rotors every  new front air suspension at  front tie rods at   air flow sensors  hazzard light switches new radiator at  miles steering angle sensor controls abs  no racingno accidentsno excuse for this experience
Audi,Engine/Performance,hunk of junk buyers beware of this audi at any pricei traded in my wifes lexus rx with k great car for a  all road with ka week after we got the audi the turn signal failed and the part cost over to make things worse it is under a front dash plate that is impossible to remove without breaking the cheap tabs that hold the metal clips  to replacewithin a month it started to leak oil and i was told that the seal was a known problem and impossible to replace without a top end tear down eight hours of labori did this repair and the trimming belt at a cost of over then a coil went and i was told to replace all six due to an audi recalla few months later warning lights started coming on and sensors that cost  plus to replace started to become commoni am now at k and i have another oil leak going to the turbo min  and the air suspension has gone bad  per wheel and should be done in pairs and my check engine and abs lights are going on and offafter owning over  cars this is truly the biggest hunk of junkaudi should step up and do a recall on the suspension and oil problems while they did the right thing by discontinuing the all road model they apparently still have many problems with the a according to a  worst rating survey and god help you if you have an amy brother gave his to the cash for clunkers program
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,pres turbo lag bad bad fuel millage

Audi,Design/Style,swiss army knife of all trades who needs a suv when car like this
Audi,Price/Value,be careful of automatic transmission the zf automatic transmission is known to have major problems in this caraudi apparently was aware that the  allroads had bad transmissions but never did a recallthe first thing to go is reverse gearit slips when going uphill backwardsreverse might be okay on level ground but not on inclineshillsits a very costly  repair and you cant replace it with a used transmission because that one will also probably go badit must be rebuiltaudi changed the transmission in  or  because they were that bad
Audi,Price/Value,not fun to fix i loved driving the allroad but i hated to fix it  every time it went to the shop it needed at least   leaks here bad parts there  oil changes mine was becoming such a money pit i was glad to sell it at a loss   the t can be tuned to make great power but it also leaks oil like a sieve and is expensive to fix  parts go bad on these cars far short of what i would consider an acceptable life span
Audi,Service/Maintenance,audi from hell after  miles the audi sevice people gave up on trying to fix the surgelag problem that my  audi allroad has developed i have spent  on new turbos a  torque converter ecu transmission control unitetc this car has had roughly  in warrenty work with no fix now they have made me an insulting offer to get me out of the car as a courtesy to buy another piece of junk audi  ive owned audi or volkswagen products since my  audi super   scirocco  quantum  a avant and  allroad and after all that they make a lame offer of settlement  its audis service problem not mine unless things change and change dramatically i will never buy another volkswagen or audi product againgo toyota

Audi,Engine/Performance,all road fan
Audi,Design/Style,mmi disappointed that i am unable to upgrade the system major flaw
Audi,Engine/Performance,not truly an r car after owning  evos i really regret buying this car  the gear box is very clunky and sounds frightening on cold shifts  the acceleration is rather flaccid because of the low torque output the brakes are mediocre and really upset the balance of the car on hard braking the engine note is horrible  on acceleration the engine makes an excruciatingly high pitched whining nose with no corresponding feeling of acceleration the steering is terribly numb requiring constant adjustments in corners understeer is its preferred mode in corners it also gets miserable gas mileage on par with cars with bigger engines and more horsepower the indash cd player went out within  miles
Audi,Service/Maintenance,the only review you need to read this car makes me want to work harder so i never have to be without onei ask my rs for permission to drive itif jerry mcguire had a rs renee zellweger would still be a single mom
Audi,Price/Value,"cabiolet  this vehicle has extensive problems with the electrical system throughout its warranty period  the dealership was consistently unable to difinitively diagnose the problem  since warranty expired about   years agothere has only been one episode so perhaps they finally did fix the source of the ongoing problems  maintenance is expensive on this vehicle as should be expected and it is not easy to find a qualified mechanic outside the dealership especially one that can accomodate my personal needs for convenience"
Audi,Engine/Performance,a pos in a shiny wrapper i drove a  audi q for days as a rental on vacation the vehicle had k miles and appeared to be of decent initial quality this however quickly diminished for reference i own a  subaru outback i limited and felt throughout my entire time driving the audi that it was far inferior to the outback in almost every way virtually every convenience in the audi was difficult to use the sunroof button has  positions two of which did nothing and the remaining three did not consistently work the buttons on the steering wheel are completely useless hardly any of which control any of the media electronics the instrument panel has the speedometer cruise control or a few other options in at least two locations but there is no indicator for headlights the interior door locks dont work with the key removed the keyfob unlock button wouldnt consistently unlock all doors wouldnt unlock the rear hatch without using the actual trunk unlock button and the car would relock shortly after unlocking making unlocking the car from a distance and then walking to the car without the keys frustrating as the doors would relock before reaching the car the turning radius is horrible for a car so small the braking system is extremely sensitive and while braking normally the vehicle would sporadically brake harder a few seconds into slowing the vehicle the cockpit is a tight fit for me being an extremely average  lbs the console is too wide causing your leg to press against it while driving steering wheel and seat adjustment were impossible to get comfortable the rear passenger space is quaint not being able to fit two adults and one year old or allowing any of them any legroom at all the absolute worst experience with the audi q was driving from santa barbara to los angeles in degrees heat slow to stoppedtraffic and a climate control malfunction rendering the air conditioning useless the fan would audibly change settings but nothing came from any of the vents no matter how we tried to adjust settings a few hours after reaching our destination the climate control worked normally the only positive aspect of the audi q is that the engine does have decent power considering its small size obviously from the turbocharger but there is no way this car was getting mpg that the trip computer was telling me overall i feel the basic frontwheeldrive audi q is nowhere near the value of a similarly priced fullyloaded allwheeldrive outback a lot of the audi felt cheap compared to the subaru and i was extremely disappointed with the lack of quality as audi is generally referred to as a highquality luxury brand the audi q is an extremely overpriced piece of frustrating garbage not that i was considering purchasing a brand of vehicle other than subaru but if i were audi would definitely not be an alternative brand i would look at
Audi,Comfort/Interior,not happy with this suv i bought this suv thinking i am getting a good deal but i am not happy with what i got  i paid extra for the navigation package and i assumed it would be touch screen  i mean why would any car manufacturer make in dash system which is not touch screen in this day and age  it sucks to enter a phone number using the inbuilt dial  the entire system is so cumbersome  it seems audi has really skimped on this model  no way to fold side mirrors and no homelink either  i am not sure what else is this model missing but i very skeptical about what audi had put in this model  i will most likely trade in this vehicle for something else this is my first and last audi
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,the worst fuel consumption by far for similar cars i had the  q premium for  months now and so far  i realy dont like it  i had a vw  tiguan previous to this car and i miss it very much
Audi,Service/Maintenance,finally got my a
Audi,Comfort/Interior,unreal i have the prestige package innovation package with night vision and the  sport packagei cannot believe how much power this car hasi mean really this car flysi was clocking  mph like it was nothing on the highwayof course i did not do it for long but i am convinced i could have had this car at  mph very quicklyoff the line it is very sharp and sends you back in the seatif you have it in sport mode it can get real stupidof course i have already had the idiot kid next to me in a lowered honda prelude with his fat muffler trying to impress his girlfriend which only led to him looking stupid in my rear view mirror
Audi,Design/Style,wow having owned an   and  as i fugured that that couldnt be be much change for was i ever wrong this car blows away any of its competitioni purchased the prestice with driver assist and cold weather packagei did not think the other options were warrantedthis car is like a smaller version of the ai love the new
Audi,Comfort/Interior,almost perfect everytime i look at my a i seem to love it just a little bit morewe looked at everything including eclass hated the plastic interior  series hated the nav system es nice car but unstimulating gs overpriced s questionable reliability and genesis couldnt bring myself to spend that much on a hyundaithe a blows them all away with the understated class and top notch interioriif i had to find one thing i would complain about the the size of the side pillar between the front and back seats i am not a card designer so i dont know the official nameits a little too thick and when making a let turn you sometimes have to lean forward to check for traffic
Audi,Engine/Performance,a avant exceeds expectations exceeds expectations in every manner
Audi,Engine/Performance,garbage where do i begin to tell the story of a car thats been a sin purchased this  a quattro in march of last year used with  miles on it its been a nightmare ever since numerous problems regarding electrical turbo and suspension components i asked the dealer if the car comes with bags of money for all the repairs that it requires and it didnt build quality on these cars is horrible we traded it in recently for a  kia forte coup sx with a nice long warranty and piece of mind
Audi,Engine/Performance,this car is bad purchased the vehicle used drove for  monthsover  in maintenance bills attempted to trade in vehicle even the audi dealer would only give me k for the tradein this car is a nightmare  my advice do not buy this vehicle especially this engine model unless youre loaded and can stomach the repair bills  buyer beware
Audi,Engine/Performance,the best and worst car ive driven the audi a t is one of the best cars ive driven it handles performance and feels so comfortable after a few months smoke came out of the tail pipes i took it in the shop and found out there was a oil leak plus coolant leak auto shop says itll be about  grand for repairs and my limited warranty didnt cover gasket and seals that stinks especially when it was about  grand for the warranty after reading other people experience with the same problems makes  me wonder audi quality kinda stinks maybe a weak gasket or bad quality seals or just the way it was build internally could lose value
Audi,Comfort/Interior,should i stay or should i go i bought a  t with  miles in september   since then i had to replace two bad turbos and oxygen sensors  after that it was a couple broken seals  then a couple months after having the  mile check up the transmission wheel drive system went out  weeks at an audi dealer waiting for parts  i had begun to notice some strange goings on with the interior lights  in addition when in heavy traffic for an extended period of time the trip meter miles before filling up flips out and a blinking time set begins to display  good thing i bought an expensive  year extended warranty with the car but im really falling out of love
Audi,Design/Style,problematic my audi a looks beautiful but this is probably the worst car i have ever had  and this includes a used  chevy monte carlo i bought for  when a freshman in college  if you buy this car be prepared to spend a lot of money for part replacements and repairs  just when you think youve seen everything this car surprises you with an unthinkable issue  my advise   buy something else
Audi,Engine/Performance,what was i thinking  the first  months were great then the problems started   weird problems you open the sun roof and the air conditioning would stop working turn the headlights on and the wind sheild wippers turn on accelerate on the highway abs lights come on brakes are applied and you couldnt go over  miles  hour  and the worst thing is the dealer doesnt know how to fix it  im gonna trade it in
Audi,Engine/Performance,performance with an interior to match i have put over  miles  total on this car and have only done minor maintenance with one minor electrical problem   buying this car used is a steal since it came with a  sticker price  find one that hasnt had problems and go and buy it
Audi,Engine/Performance,"could have been a contender this car has a solid and subtle design  the interior is laid out well with exception to the climate control  performance is also exceptional with the factory performance package and overall features are above average  warranty and scheduled service was handled professionally and efficiently that said the implementation of the socalled solid design is extremely poor based on the number of trips to the dealer for serious defects and warranty service and recalls i give a very low reliability rating for this car and i would never buy another audi again"
Audi,Price/Value,"loosens up  too expensive to maintain we are faced with putting k of routine maintenance into this disappointing ride  turbos clogged oil leaks suspension problems etc  it was billed to us as a family sedan w some pickupandgo  i had no idea it would be more expensive to fix than a porsche  next time ill just buy one of those instead  also the car drives much looser now compared to my e benz  audi can keep its line of products for  the gear heads"
Audi,Price/Value,read before you consider buying i have owned my  audi a quattro for almost a year now and have have problem after problem from a rearend differential to a  dollar steering module just to start the car even though there were no problems mechanically i caution you if youre thinking about buying a used audi a to keep thinking and move on because this car will nickel and dime you until you cant afford to fix it anymore
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,not very good service in  years this car has not had any big issues until recently  since the dealer replaced a recall part of a fuel filter or pump the car periodically does not start  eventually it does i havent had to be towed yet  it has been in repair regularly since october and they say it is not replicating what i describe  after several attempts at this the dealer now has called in a special engineer to work on my car  i am now driving a low budget a loaner as the dealer still has my car and has not returned any of my calls  audi usa service is just as unresponsive and very robotic with all of their responses  they are of no help
Audi,Engine/Performance,buyer beware i made the mistake of buying the a with the v and the sports suspension  this car is better with standard suspension and all season tires for sure  the combo i bought makes the car ride way too stiff  also  the outside temp indicator randomly malfunctions and reads  degress lower than the temp really is  seems that this is occuring when the ac is on  dealer refuses to do anything because it doesnt happen when they have the car  the automatic transmission is the worst i have ever driven  it switches way to fast when starting from a stop   there is no vent only setting on the climate control  i have never heard of such a thing
Audi,Service/Maintenance,disappointed several problems occurred upon delivery like need to replace warped brake rotors repair vacuum leak and splitting paint and rust along welded seam on roof  also problem with radio turning on by itself several times each time car is started  dealer cannot fix  seats not very comfortable on long drives despite being very adjustable brake feel is mushy and uncertain  i traded a  a for this car and although the ride and safety features have improved i prefer the old one
Audi,Design/Style,it was my second choice i considered and drove the usual suspects in this class while the a rise to my top spot among the german imports i found the design and features to be a bit dated probably about two years behind the swedish and other imports
Audi,Comfort/Interior,stay away from this model problems included first two within  months of warranty expiration  electronic window malfunction  led dashboard diplay went out  broken plastic in console lid cup holders  seat levers  bad cvc joints and suspension assemblies  broken camshaft  blown motor at  miles no hard driving  well maintained
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,this car has been big trouble for me the car is now eight years old but has just k miles the last three to four years i have sunk a ton of money into it every time i think im past the worst something else happens most of it has been replacing the water pump timing belt etc but there are things i have not repaired that should be eg the instrument panel and am radio the information box is barely readable and requires a whole new instrument panel  am radio went out years ago  estimate to repair was  i was about to trade the car in the fall but it needed  in work thought i would keep it a while longer now the tranny goes bad reverse  clutch and the estimate is k ill never own another audi
Audi,Comfort/Interior,too bad warranty ended when it did let me start off by saying i love the interior design comforts the car has been reliable but as soon as the warranty expired the indash cd and the hud info window started failing stopped all togther  audi is aware of the hud issues very common issue but refuses to address it out of warranty and is very expensive to fix
Audi,Price/Value,too much maintenance bought used at  miles now has  miles fun to drive solid no squeaks or rattles replaced  sensors one of them twice always  a pop replaced gasket to stop oil leak and burnt oil smell but hasnt worked some front end alignment issues also no am radio reception first foreign car ive owned not sure if ill stay with audi more expensive maintenance than my previously owned ford products

Audi,Design/Style,not works looking the car is plagued with door dings and minor scratches  i found two separate leaks oil and coolant  the dealer stated the car underwent a coolant leak fix but when i asked for the receipt they could not produce one  as for the oil leak they were unaware
Audi,Engine/Performance,dont drive if you spend winters driving to ski country car has some great features but expect problems with front brake rotorsi was hoping audi would correct brakes and after problems with my  allroad i switched to a mercedes  series after  miles i traded in on original brakes now my a  again has warped rotors after  miles pads only about  worn or less this was same problem in allroad it just cost me  dollars after  dealer discount  a true joke i usually use engine during down hills and am carefull not to heat brakes i think that it may be slush or cold rain that cold shocks the rotors when audi covered these under warranty i did not mind they stopped this in  probably due to frequency  so
Audi,Service/Maintenance,delayed acceleration and squeaky brakes when i took delivery of my car and the brakes were very loud the salesman told me this was just a temporary problem and would go awayit has only been worse srevice dept replybrakes squeak  my  other vehicles do not have squeaky brakes  the worst problem however is the delayed acceleration at slow speeds i will not let other family members drive this car it is not safe and again the service reps say thats just the way it is i will never buy another i own  lexuses and have had no problems that were not taken care of ditto that for the  bmws audis indifference to these acknowledged problems is beyond belief

Audi,Engine/Performance,what you really need to know before you buy i have two major issues with the a first is the extremely annoying stopstart of the engine each time you stop the car for a traffic light stop sign heavy traffic etc you can turn off the feature if you remember to do so each time you get into the car but you will often forget even with the feature turned off you can feel the engine thinking of turning off i absolutely hate this feature and will not buy another vehicle with it the second issue relates to the very low feature of the tires there are only a few inches between the road and rim ive had two blow outs because of the narrow space between road and rim one blowout was from hitting a curb and another from a pot hole both situations would not have happened with regular height tires at about  a replacement this is a very expensive problem

Audi,Engine/Performance,not bad but still disappointed coming from series bmw i see a few faults in this car horrible gas mileage for a  liter engine im getting about  mpg in traffic with rather conservative driving habits navigation system is ok but certainly missing street routing and traffic display for local streets that im acostoumed to relay on for my daily commute engine vibration while not a deal breaker can be pretty annoying in stop and go traffic controls are less than intuitive may be personal preference
Audi,Service/Maintenance,worst car ever vehicle started leaking oil and running rough at less than k dealer would not repair finaly after many complaints dealer found coolant was leaking into the head gaskets short story is dealer has had the head gaskets out  separate times to resurface car still leaking oil repaired that several times i was told the car is like a piece of cheese when one hole is fixed another opens up that must be professional mechanic speak car has been in  times for serious repair in less than  years
Audi,Comfort/Interior,audi  fwd i purchased my audi  fwd two years ago used had k miles on it at the time  i was surprised with the average gas mileageaveraged  mpg over the past two years  on the down side i spent a lot of time in the shop for small items some covered by warranty  repairs included new battery  cv boots head light two tail lights  on average i spent  per year in repairs not including oil changes brakes and tiresrotations  overall interior quality was less than i expected  the seats showed significant wear the radioheating buttons writing wore off and the wood plastic cracked during my two years of ownership  i previously owned a saab  and had none of these problems

Audi,Engine/Performance,frustrating this is my first experience wiuth audi after owning volvos saabs and bmws i bought the car this past summer with k miles on the audi cpo program the brakes are touchygrabby but ive learned thats a common trait with the a and ive learned to live with it and adjust at k miles the engine quit in traffic and i had to have it towed to the dealer for repair it turned out to be a faulty low fuel pressure sensor and this was repaired under warranty the following week a simple daylight running light bulb went out and this an only be repaired at the dealer
Audi,Engine/Performance,poor audi quality i am not impressed with audi build quality or reliability  in the first month of ownership i had to have the dealer replace a howling power steering pump  the car has a sunroof water leak that the dealer cant fix  the floor gets wet in a hard rain storm otherwise performance and handling are quite good as are the electronics on the car
Audi,Engine/Performance,not happy well have had my a for just  yrs now and  miles and the problems just keep on coming first was the seat controls separating from the seat at  and not covered under warranty charged  to tighten bolt next was the xenon headlight going on and off dealer said it was what they do when they are about to go bad  then car started to run rough and engine light on told computer issue but that did not fix it then back to shop to find out it was carbon build up major engine work fixed under warranty this time otherwise over  to fix dealer said that its because the gas today is not high enough octane to work with audis new engine design whats next my last audi
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,plagued with problems my a continues to be plagued with problems spent  days in the shop over thanksgiving oil seals on all  cylinders had to be replaced a major job on a car with only k miles the carbon buildup issue which was initially attributed to a computer reprogram turned out to be failing seals i also mentioned a rattlesqueak from the front left suspension dealer greased the suspension per audi directives but to no avail car was in the shop for  week now it turns out that it may be a bushing problem a known issue amongst audis and i am being asked to take the car back again  btw  jdpower only gives the a a  rating which is on the cusp of below average
Audi,Price/Value, a owner do not by one of these unless you are willing to shell out  for service and repairsshortly after k you will notice small issue that result in very costly repairs regardless of being diligent in regards to preventive maintenancecvts are not a good idea the controller tcm tend to fail before the cvt either way you are looking at a minimum of  if you want an audi buy one with a clutch or pay for extended warrenties they are worth it
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,not worth it although its a beutiful luxurious car there are a lot of trouble spots first the oil change costs over  every time because it requires  quarts of synthetic plus oil next the fuel economy is terrible gets no more than  on the city possibly  on the highway next i had water pumps break under the car which resulted in flooding of the floor and a horrible mildew smell this happened  times beautiful appearence but too many cons to reccomend instead i reccomend the lexus gs or infiniti m
Audi,Service/Maintenance,lousy audi spent a total of  months at the dealer for repair of sunroof  times noise in suspensions never fixed  the dealer gave up suggested i buy another car blew transmission after  miles again dealer suggested i should have bought a quatro instead of a cvt still has noises in the liner suspension rattles in the door and seats do yourself a favor do not bay an audi
Audi,Design/Style,st audi after  bmws wow is all i can say  and im sorry that i was a bmw snob for too many years  i bought the audi primarily because i was looking for awd in the winter  having only had the car now for one month in the summer im truly sorry that i didnt consider an audi prior to this  this car is the ultimate driving machine
Audi,Engine/Performance,tight ride this audi is refined yet subtle  those around you cannot appreciate this cars ability  wolf in sheeps sheet metal
Audi,Comfort/Interior,costly to own read before buying i bought the car for dependability and i have been in the shop more than anyone i know with what people consider lesser cars i have replaced all ball joints twice over and i do not drive hard replaced rotors breaks the heated tinted mirrors are peeling on one side some interior items just broke at a touch went thru a period of the car starting randomly currently revisiting that problem again the dash diplay fades out the car had low mileage when i purchased it and had been maintained by the previous owners thanking myself for not selling my old car as it has been there for me when the audi fails i do not think i would buy one again not impressed
Audi,Comfort/Interior, audi wagon my wife got the car  days ago and she loves it
Audi,Price/Value,"the worst car ever created for the k this car cost it should bereliable  its not   major problemsand  minor ones in  years  i wishid bought two k mazdas instead ill never buy another audi  ever"
Audi,Comfort/Interior,"it has sucked my bank account dry i bought my car with k its been in the shop on the average of oncemonth since ive had it for the past year it costs a fortune to maintain ive had to replace the control panel computer the brakes the automatic window guide the water pump the speaker wiring for the phone the passenger seat controls i had to change a tire yesterday the jack is worthless in the snow its cantilevered design would not work on a snowy but hard surface im hoping to trade it in for a subaru i wish i had gotten one to begin with but i was totally seduced by the comfort and quiet of the audi"
Audi,Engine/Performance,"aavant we chose the aavant knowing about its relatively poor gas mileage and its underpowered engine these were acceptable given the cars smooth quiet ride awd capability and styling we did not expect an unending series of repairs and recalls though we had problems with the fuelsending unit the instrument display cluster the rearwindow lockout control the rear speakers the radiocd player x the windshield washer sensor an engine hose and front window clips unfortunately these problems seem common for audi and i would not recommend the aavant"
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,"a avant we like the car but it is slightly underpowered and too many little things go wrong ie spearkersone front one rear the brakes make too much dust and the climate control will allow the temp to get too hot on cold days before getting the correct temp the fuel pump went out over night so the car had to be towed in to be repaired the cost of the pump was  and was not in stock"
Audi,Engine/Performance,"great car expensive to maintain the audi a wagon has been a pleasure to drive  its single drawback is a grossly underpowered engine  although the numbers tell you that you can do  in  sec it sure doesnt feel it  the car is solid and heavy which may contribute to the slow sensation  my biggest dissapointment was a  repair bill three months after the  month warrantee expired  all of the repairs were for items that had declined overtime and appear to be not unexpected in audis air conditioner sensor  controller failure ignition key mechanism failure  maybe the new  month warrantee will catch these things if not enjoy he car but watch out"
Audi,Comfort/Interior,classy ride i read other reviews and was wary of this model but the test drive swayed me  this does not drive like a  lb car  coming from a bmw  i felt some difference but not that much acceleration isnt blazing and gas mileage is disappointing but the interior is topnotch  no mechanical problems yet after  miles  i am baffled how a windshield wiper fluid tank can spring a leak though  not as easy to get to  mph as the bimmer
Audi,Engine/Performance,not the german quality i was sold big bucks lemon good ride and comfort but has the same quality as my  pontiac   back then even gm treated me better with problems then my dealer or contacting audi direct dozens of small items broke from washer covers window switches xs times front bumper cover digital dashboard front axel tranny leaks engine leaks which they wouldnt acknowledge  until the warranty was over to final disgrace when the air bags failed to work when i totaled it  days before i was to trade this nightmare in at a lost  as the resale value also is horrible dont believe the german quality myth
Audi,Engine/Performance,high maintenance i bought a  audi a as certified vehicle with a two year warranty  one month before the warranty went up the water pump went out while i was doing  mph on a trip out of town  the pump went out causing the engine to lock up and timing belt to come off  after all was said and done  weeks later the costs for repair was around   i searched for warranties to extend the car from  miles to  miles but the cheapest i could find was   i chose not to get one because i didnt think i would spend that much in repairs  shortly after the alternator went out costing  the whole front bumper and radiator has to be removed to get to it its almost impossible to do repairs yourself and finding an independent repair shop is just as hard
Audi,Engine/Performance,"fix the electrics my  audi a sedan is fun to drive but is slow off the line unless you use the tiptronic shifter in first gear and stomp on it the ride is soft for hard driving but very comfortable the power options crap out and nit pick you too death basically i like the car though"
Audi,Design/Style,german disappointment bought the car used  still under audi
Audi,Service/Maintenance, audi a quartro  several items had to be replaced during
Audi,Comfort/Interior,"a sedan too many repairs very poor build quality for a  car  does not compare in quality to my acura  tls and lacks standard features found on comparable cars audi repairs replace gas gauge replace digital dash replace door hinge rebuild drivers seat replace rear seat back latches front grill inserts fell out  overall bad value for the money  audi is not a quality builder of cars"
Audi,Design/Style,audi by jj solid construction  no rattles
Audi,Design/Style, audi i like the car
Audi,Design/Style,i hate my audi i loved it to start withbut now it
Audi,Service/Maintenance,audi a review i drive my audi a  miles each day
Audi,Engine/Performance," audi a  after  months i bought a new a prestige  in may  cold weather package led  sport packageetcafter owning the car for  months i can say that it is comfortable quiet and delivers enough power with the twin turbo engine but this car is not a sport sedan  it has a tendency to understeer and the dynamic driving mode doesnt seem to help with suspension stiffness  the power comes in around k rpm when the turbo come oncar interior  id give it a b based on the fact that it has  zone climate control ventilated seats quiet cabin shades but these are all options you have to pay for  door trim needs leather instead of plastic  mmi system is a fail"
Audi,Service/Maintenance,"too tempermental  bought used with  k miles since i bought it two weeks ago it has spent  and  weeks in shop with electrical problems i love this car when it works i dont have the time or patience to continue taking it in for repairs im very disappointed if i can unload it it will be back to japanese cars for me"
Audi,Service/Maintenance,loyality will now be spelled audi my experience with the a has been
Audi,Price/Value,"love the car  hate the repairs great looking and riding car but impossible to keep running  by  miles it had a new water pump  and needed new valve gaskets cam gasket axle flange gaskets and a new rear differential  i thought i was going to miss the luxury when i traded it in but it was a real relief to get rid of the expensive repairs  the audi dealership had the attitude if you dont have enough income to be giving lots of money to us  tough"
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,"dont buy this piece of junk i bought my car used with about  miles on it  i have driven it about  miles and over the  months ive owned it have had the car in the shop  times not minor things either  new upper and lower oil pans bad fuel injection system all new sparksetc basically everthing but the tranny this car is the most unreliable piece of junk i have ever had the displeasure of owning  now i know why the previous owner traded it in at  miles he was sick and tired of the unrealibility too  i cant wait to trade this hunk of junk in"
Audi,Price/Value,german junk expensive to repair many trips to the dealership
Audi,Service/Maintenance,audi rs until i find something faster this is

Audi,Design/Style,little audi red convertible
Audi,Service/Maintenance, audi s
Audi,Comfort/Interior,awesome bought my us spec auto s over here in stuttgart germany  the st  miles break in period was hard to do on the autobahn  i have slowly stepped it up since and will not really see what it can do until i have passed the  mile mark  all and all so far it has been everything i have expected  a few things i have noted are that the ipod option does not come with an ipod adaptor  seats are a  on long trips due to comfort and i have noticed that the tires seem a little narrow over  mph  if you need to do an emergency slow down the back end seems to want to get away from you but the esp kicks in and keeps it under control  overall i still give it a
Audi,Engine/Performance,gremlin with horrible support ok i leased with intent on buying  as soon as i leased i bought snow tiresrims clear bra on front and weather tech mats audi service package and i do extra oil changes between their service interval w audi approved oil  very well cared for from my end car has k miles  in k miles i have had car shut off on highway from overheating dealer added antifreeze but it was above minimum and ive never had a car just shut off  dealer said drive it in  next ive had multiple electrical problems  says doesnt recognize key then i walk away come back and it recognizes then problem goes away for weeks  then brake light out signal comes up on dash brake lights are functioning and on took video of it took to audi  says no engine code would have to tear car down to look for a short   so i wait to have them take care of it and it doesnt do it for months  intermittently it will occur  just give it a day or two and it goes away   then i was rear ended while stopped at light k damages and frameuni needed pulled to straighten  had audi shop do the work got the car back and it vibrates badly from mph  take it to body shop they send me to sunnyside audi service in middleburg oh dealer service says everything is straight and balanced and no problem with their work but they can put new tires on and balance them for   i reply that the car didnt do this before accident they say they dont know  i exclaim that the tires on there have plenty of wear left as i have snow tires and the tires have less than a year of road use  they cant tell me why they would shake then  i ask for a guarantee that it would stop if replaced cant give me a guarantee  i call audi america and they send me back to dealer  its a run around shell game thats completely disappointing   i am  sure that the car did not do this before accident and even said if you replace them and it fixes it i will pay for them  if it doesnt then you figure out what is wrong no luck  so in my short experience as a first time audi owner i have only been given run around on a car with clear issues and horrible repair work dealer even washed the car immediately after their repair shop did a paint job you dont wash and wax a car with fresh paint until it cures at least  days sunny side audi should know this  anyway each department sends me back to the next with no guarantee  ive had a rental car for a total of  weeks in year  ive not had any resolution  i will come back and post  a vin if anyone purchases this vehicle and has problems which arent disclosed at purchase  audi america is aware dealership is aware and you should get an attorney  if you get this lemon post a reply on my post and i will get back to you with an emailgive you records of incidents so you may use them for recompense  ps i asked repair shop to make sure carfax is aware they say they dont report  nationwide insurance company couldnt give me an answer if they would report the k  caveat emptor but i hope whoever buys this and has problems finds this post  just horrible customer service run around  but alot of apologies ie    we care we can send you back to  ive owned toyota honda ford and acura where the buck stops at dealer if any problems   acura replaced an   engine part under extended warranty and  years after  no longer in warranty the same part had an issue  acura fixed it free of charge under good faith that it was a bad part  that is service   audi has provided no service other than free rental cars and offer to sell me more stuff to maybe fix it
Audi,Service/Maintenance,horrible experience with audi a cabriolet i leased a new  audi a cabriolet from audi palo alto in october a few weeks back as the car was climbing a hill enroute to lombard street in san francisco in traffic it started slipping backwards and refused to accelerate upwards the cars behind me naturally honked and drivers were mad at my car not only blocking traffic but slipping backwards when i switched off the car and tried restarting it would not start for  min after  min it started again and went up  feet and again slipped backwards somehow after an hour long traumatic experience i got out of the hill following this i had a horrible experience with the service team at audi palo alto too
Audi,Service/Maintenance,holy cow what a pos had the car for four months dealership had it for half that time power window issues that couldnt be fixed charged me each time as if warranty didnt exist shaking at certain speeds mph and then again at mph dealership told me i had to buy four new wheelsand that didnt fix it nav didnt work for days on end for some reason and then randomly started working again one of the worst cars ive ever owned dont be fooled with how great this car looks because it is an overpriced piece of junk i ended up trading it in to be rid of it because it was leeching my time money and sanity
Audi,Service/Maintenance,very unreliable i owned a brand new  audi a for about  months and it was plagued with problems windows that wouldnt go back up burning oil a transmission that stopped shifting nav and tech issues while not ideal all of this would have been ok if audi actually fixed these problems andor didnt attempt to charge me to fix these problems when i brought the car in for service that is the ultimate problem with this car and the brand they dont support you after the purchase of the vehicle ive heard excuse upon excuse on why they are not responsible for anything that goes wrong with the car i traded it for a bmw series and what a difference in the service you receive i will never buy an audi again
Audi,Engine/Performance,truth in mpg  update vw diesel scandel has changed my opinion  degrees cant wait to trade away from this car dont want to be associated with vw audi who knows what other representations are false safety  reliability
Audi,Engine/Performance,horrible service bought a  audi a a little over a month ago great car but having problems with the navigation mmi already tells me that the car is somewhere i am not and doesnt catch the speed traps which all other audis do here in korea took it to audi korea service center twice and they cant figure it out basically told me i am out of luck this is of course after taking my car our for a  km joy ride and unplugging the black box so there would be no evidence expect for my empty gas tank i just hope audi headquarters finds a solution to fix the mmi because the audi korea dealership and service center are incompetent and horrible please hire employees that know how to fix their own produc
Audi,Engine/Performance,acceleration issue less than  miles on the car and ive noticed a sudden loss in power twice now when accelerating from a stop once from a traffic light was simply annoying and the nd time pulling out of a parking spot into traffic was dangerous anyone else notice this  the normal performance is great  the car is at the dealer for repair now
Audi,Price/Value,audi a dissapointed although my audi a is fun to drive and handles well i am extremely disappointed by the frequency and cost of repairs and cost of maintenancemy  a has only k miles but i have spent about  in repairs in maintence in the past two yearsthat is inexcusable and not something i expected from a supposedly high end auto manufactureractively looking for a new car
Audi,Engine/Performance,design error have an a love it decided to get an a  worse mileage than our truck turns  rpms at highway speed cant even make mph in st gear  terrible design point weve contacted audi they blame everyone else dealer etc   but it is the worst design i have seen in  years of buying cars  lighter than the a same power v smaller and about mpg worse than the a  blows my mind  we wont touch audi again  due to audi usa refusing to discuss acknowledge suggest fixes ie different gear ratio in the differentials  by the way im an engineer have extensive auto experience
Audi,Engine/Performance,not a good purchase i purchased the premium package with the white exterior and dark grey interior  this is a good looking car but i have had so many problems with it  exteriorly the trim on the sky system keeps on popping off  i had to bring my vehicle in  times to get this fixed  the pirelli tires that come stock are terrible i had to replace the fronts under  and the rear   now i am having engine problems with the transmission  recommendation dont purchase this vehicle also very noisy while driving past  mph especially if you get the roof racks which are also junk  mine broke the first week i got them
Audi,Comfort/Interior,think twice before you buy since i bought my brand new car i never got more than  mpg the gas cover got locked the back of the front seat fell it ran out of of oil more than  times the th door froze and was impossible to open the tires wore out   to replace them  the stick shift locks in the worst moments it is so noisy inside you can not hear the radio open the window when raining all the water goes inside because of bad design every time you want to open the front window you open the rear one because of bad design not what you think you are buying  this is expensive junk
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,joses review
Audi,Price/Value,fun to drive poor to maintain we bought  a in  with only  miles on itit is fun to drive it feels like a race horse wishing to run  this thing is made for highway driving its ability to accelerate and maneuver is the best i have ever felt  that said it is annoying to drive in city the least little bit of pressure on accelerator causes it to jump sometimes too far too fastit is very uncomfortable  awkard to get in and out of and i am an average size american guy   lbs  the worst aspect is the inability to find qualified reliable mechanics who are willing to work on the vehicle   i have owned ford isuzu honda  and toyotas  i never had an issue with find qualified mechanics with those brands here it took awhile to find one outside of a dealership  audi has a management software that few mechanics have access to and i live in south florida not middle of nowhere montana north dakota  etcalso due to low profile  going over any railroad tracks or potholes can be annoying at best or expensive at worst we went over one and fractured the radiator support which needed to be replaced  i saw later that it was made completely of plastic  how cheap  a frontend structural support made of plastic  how cheap on audi
Audi,Design/Style,rereview to bad i posted a review after i bought my audi last august raving about it  i now wish to retract my raves  the ride and fun level are all greatbut i am burning thru a quart of oil about every    miles  i cant even make it to a regular oil change without the light coming on or me putting oil in it sometimes twice  terrible  i am dumping this thing before it dies on me  i drive  mile a day and cant risk being left on the side of the road audi care or not  i am going back to a honda or toyotaloved both  too bad such a beautiful car
Audi,Comfort/Interior,problems with audi with only  miles on my brand new a the power window is broken the power seat for the driver is broken and now the transmission is giving problems  i will never buy another audi again this is the most problamatic car i have ever had worst than the old ford explorer  i am going to ask for a refund
Audi,Engine/Performance,not reliablenever again just after warranty the manifold went badthe injectors went badafter five years of ownership the main engine seal and the oil separator went bad  and the fuse housing under the hood melted i have been driving for  years and i have gotten bad gasoline with this car twicenever before in  years has that occurredthe car is over engineered and too temperamentalvws ive owned were also unreliableif you have plenty of money and time to spend at the shop you may consider this a fun car
Audi,Price/Value,only one problem my  a   t the only problem after four yrs are the sunshiled clips i take the car to every service on the book does somebody knows where i can buy those clips used  just the clips they cost around  each at the dealer  about  of labor
Audi,Engine/Performance,what a dissapointment have had this car for  years now and im completely dissapointed in the craftsmanship and performance of this car so far i have had to replace fuel pump water pump and thermostat air conditioner evaporator left tail light bulb about a dozen times even though dealer swears there is nothing electrically wrong sun roof shade clips break just by looking at them in addition the paint on most of the dash board control buttons is flaking out and the paint in the pillars between the doors is about to fall off probably one of the worst cars i have ever owned
Audi,Engine/Performance,so much for german engineering it seems that germans have not discovered aluminum all the interior design is in plastic with silly parts that break and are not covered by the warranty of course the crooks from the dealer will charge  for any stupid part and make you wait for a week to get it i used the back seat arm rest once and it broke i plugged an ipod in the cigarette lighter and it broke the two moon light roof hatches broke the bolt that holds the spare tire broke etc in addition the car gets a check engine light every six months as another reviewer noted i had to change the pirelli tires at k miles because they were really noisy finally the dealers are pretty bad but thats another post
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,reliability is terrible ive had an audi a  and its been nothing but trouble with numerous repair visits to the dealer covered by warranty until recently  the problem areas have been the fuel injection system and various electronic components  just in the last  months ive been to the dealer  times  if you like to spend time in the waiting room of your dealership this is the car for you  otherwise there are much better and cheaper choices out there
Audi,Service/Maintenance,a tire noise i love the car however at  miles i complained about tire noise the dealers response was to replace the tires i felt that this answer was inadequate am i supposed to replace my tires every  miles audi obviously knows about the problem on the a but refuses to do anything about it this has soured me on the car i will never buy another audi
Audi,Engine/Performance,very very disappointed i was excited to finally own an audi  at first the car was fun to drive then things started to go wrong at around  miles  first the diaphragm for the turbo  then the dsm transmission failed had to get towed after my dealer rebuilt the transmission the car lurches into gear never a smooth take off  last week the entire cam shaft had to be replaced because the lobes on the shaft that drive the fuel pump worn completely through the follower and into the pump itself  check engine light comes on constantly  engine uses  quart of oil every  miles  sun roof cover has been broken  times since i got the car and now is fixed with a temporary paper clip  ugghhh
Audi,Engine/Performance,dissapoinment the reliability has been terrible back in shop over and over again in the past six months the warranty and the extended warranty has been useless always pondering what will break next not fun when you are driving a seven year old around
Audi,Comfort/Interior,mighty little hatchback i recently purchased an a t with the intention of having a daily driver that offered economy as well as reliability  my immediate impression once i climbed into the well fitted interior was that this was a drivers cockpit  as i pressed the little vehicle i soon lost sight of the mundane purpose and started focusing on how incredibly fun this car was to drive  i must confess with a stable of alternatives i often find myself firing up the little hatchback as a prefered choice  imagine that  this vehicle hits the bullseye like willy tell  compare this vehicle to anything available in this meager price range and you would be hard pressed to find such a tightly wound package
Audi,Engine/Performance,agility and speed overall an exciting car to drive im able to navigate busy dc with little problem and the dsg tranny is kickin the only complaint i have is the driver seat seems to be losing its support seats started out firm but now they are uncomfortable limited thigh support for my  frame sunroof is a blast wanted allwheel but didnt want the  cylinder overall a kickin car to drive
Audi,Price/Value,wish i had never bought an a unfortunately i bought a  a cvt no cvt for me anymorei was so dissatisfied with the car we traded it with just under  miles for a jetta wolfsburg turbo a little over a year later the vw was traded for a crv and we bought an a outrightit was a bit of a gamble  driving to atlanta from orlando to pick it up  but well worth the journey we bought it certified with k miles and turned around and drove it home a little fatigued we didnt fully appreciate the long trip and the road noise is a little i stress little much but now that were back home were tickledthe manual is responsive the steering firm the look is mature but not pretentious this is a drivers car
Audi,Price/Value,purchased because of iihs top safety pick will never purchase another vw audi or vag product again total inaction after years of waiting on the takata airbag recall tdi buyback is beyond tedious waiting over  months for an offer letter
Audi,Engine/Performance,a tdi review  edmonds doesnt offer option what a disappointment ok for  years k miles then problems began  months of a slow coolant leak which dealer could not find had to keep a gallon of coolant with me at all times finally after warranty expired the dealer replaced the water pump to cure the problem wanted to charge me for it after pointing out that it had been in three times over the past  months they decided it was under warranty now with k miles the waste gate regulation valve on the turbo has failed along with a pressure line to the turbo i previously owned a jetta tdi given to my son whose turbo failed at k miles  this failure occurred after i had bought the audi so far up to about  in repairs on a car with has lost  of its value due to the emissions shenanigans i am waiting to see if audi will offer to buy it back a recent court settlement calls for them to buy back the older tdis on the road and repair read destroy the good mileage the newer ones needless to say this is my last vwaudi productaddendum  audi will buy back the car at the end of this month while it seems to be running ok after two day long visits to the shop the check engine light came on shortly after the  repair to the waste gate with the same error code the dealer said we would be glad to take a look at it i asked if that meant like after the first repair failed they would charge  per hour to diagnose it they said they would diagnose it to the tune of  worth i did not take it in as i will not put any more money into it i am letting it sit in the garage until the buy back in two weeks audi and particularly my local dealership are awful
Audi,Price/Value,all owners must have an extended warranty i was so excited to buy this car  it looks great gets above average gas mileage and i thought it was going to be dependablei was absolutely incorrect and it has cost me a significant amount of money  the warranty expired at k which is when the major system began to fail  first it was the motor in the seatnot a huge deal but it was expensive  next the ac compressor failed an issue that audi is aware of and has issued a service advisory about but without a warranty one that i had to pay for  finally the turbo charger failed at this rate it will have all new parts before it hits k  this car is crap and audi should be ashamed that they built it
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,a etron is all audi no autoengine start
Audi,Design/Style,what a rocketship this understated rocketship lets those
Audi,Engine/Performance,refined experience for refined tastes i traded my  to to get what i perceived to be a peaceful luxury car that delivers a violent soulful motor on command i couldnt be happier no more annoying tire noise competing with the sometimes flatuent contrived exhaust note instead i get full luxury including doublepaned windows and felt lined wheelwells to ensure tranquility punctuated by refined violence upon driver demand  i also get an ipod interface and bluetooth when i miss my  i can always take out my   for a visceral run and when i really require a jolt my f delivers without fail the s is always the car i reach for first that says a lot
Audi,Design/Style,amasing everyone dis car is simply the
Audi,Comfort/Interior,"audi dissapoints in  miles its been in for service  different times and ive been without vehicle a total  days power steering rack control module interior trim windshield washer pump intermitent alarm codes etc i still lose my power steering off and on regularly i was told by sales manager that the a i traded in would pale in comparison to the quality of the s   sticker this is as close to a lemon as ive ever owned"
Audi,Design/Style,great car infuriating controls fantastic car great handling styling and quality the mmi controls will drive you insane the simplest function becomes very complex  turning on the heated seats solar shade etc the navigation system  thought was broken numerious major addresses in major cities could not be found turns out for  you dont enter the city but the county of location that is insane florida has like  counties no idea where one starts and stops
Audi,Engine/Performance,the fm radio of my s broke down in  month i bought my audi s brand new november in december the radiator broke down after a argument  the dealer agreed to replace the coolant with no chargetodaymarch  the fm radio brokethere is nothing display on the screen and there is no soundyesterday the screen went blank for about  minutesthen after we turned off the engine about  hour later when we turned on the engine back the fm came back to normaltoday we try the same thing but it doesnt worki am really start to hate this cari will keep posting everything that will go wrong with my car
Audi,Comfort/Interior,no compromise ive had this rocket sled for just
Audi,Comfort/Interior,"fun to drive but not fun to own the car is fast and very fun to drive  the large trunk allows me to use it like a truck  although my experience with the car has been going down hill since i drove it off the lot  with less than k miles it is already making creaking noises in the cabin  the radio has already been replaced bc of failure  i have the m tranny and the clutch has already failed requiring the car to be in the shop for  weeks  immediately after that it went back into the shop for a week for a failed thermostat  this is the last audi i will purchase  i plan to sell it before the warranty expires"
Audi,Service/Maintenance,love it i have had my s convertible for about a year and a half and love it  i cant tell you how many people have commented on my cool car  the car is insane around corners and i have beaten porche boxters on regular occasions in races  the car almost keeps up with my business partners bmw m  i have an automatic and there is a little lag time when you step on the gas but once it gets moving it moves like crazy
Audi,Engine/Performance,"audi s i have owned this car now for six months no problems so far with the exception of the windblockers design  very flimsy retaining clips the engine is superb  too bad that the car is way too heavy detracting from the performance the poor fuel economy is due the weight as well nevertheless i am amazed that i could not think of any serious complaint about the car so far i will have to get winter tiresrims for it and at  they are not cheap but they are essential for winter mobility would i buy the car again in a heartbeat"
Audi,Engine/Performance,sleeper wagon this is my second s also have a
Audi,Engine/Performance,quattro delight i have a  and while we have only had it
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,never again in the  months ive owned this vehicle i put in over  in repairs  maintenance  something is continually going wrong with this car  fuel gauge unit throttle body fuel line abs control unit cv boot turn signal  these were not minor repairs as the parts and labor were very expensive  i hope to sell this care very soon  i will never own another audi
Audi,Engine/Performance,"fundamental design flaw there is a reason audi stopped selling ars with the  liter engine  the engine is flawed by designthe  ss b platform all came with k turbo chargers  given the way the  liter engine in the s was designed this turbo does not have adequate cooling to prolong its life  it will fail even if you dont race or chip the car  when the turbos fail it requires removal of entire engine to replace them  this is close to  in labor and parts  the problem can be avoided in the future by replacing the k with k turbos but its expensive this flawed design has contributed to the lousy resale value  do not buy this car stay away"
Audi,Engine/Performance,a wolf in sheeps clothing i have owned a lot of cars through my
Audi,Engine/Performance,performance pkus mpg effortless power with the supercharged v can be run as docile as any grocerygetter but coax it slightly and it will respond with extreme urgency  all while attaining  mpg
Audi,Price/Value,steering issues overall the s is a very nice car plenty of power and good overall handling mpg is good as well averaging  combined in  miles tires that come on the car are summer tires not sure why they deliver a car in nj in december with summer tires do not try to get through the winter with them you will need to put all season tires onnavigation is not up to par with other vehicles i have owned and slow to load data and respond also no touch screen biggest issue i have is with the electric steering the on center feel is terrible worst part about it is audi acknowledges there is a problem but has no solutiondealer says audi is working on it car is  months old and still no solution
Audi,Comfort/Interior, audi s avant i bought the s avant specifically not the sedan because i have dogs and they go everywhere with me  im more than frustrated with the air circulation in this car i live in phoenix audi absolutely missed the boat when it comes to the comfort of anyone not sitting in the front  there are no air vents in the back except on the floor and while there are air vents in the back of the car theyre only for defrosting and work only when heat comes through them  im forced to drive my volvo for four months out of the year because its literally cruel to have my dogs baking in the back even though the ac is on high  dont buy this car unless you plan to only have one passenger
Audi,Engine/Performance,wish i had my  s back i so wanted to love this car after enjoying my  so much but although its fast and fun the mpg is pathetic my  averaged  but i got  on cruises in the rockies and electrical gremlins are numerous strut replacement at  is obscene and why water dribbles out of the side panels days after a wash is pathetic the alcantara wears very badly
Audi,Engine/Performance,great looker  very poor reliability this is my second s i had a  previously and my th audi the design is great interior elegant and ergonomic and it performs great but the reliability has been miserable i only kept it for  months  it was in the shop every month of those  months it went through brake rotors had a coolant leak an transmission cooler leak the abs system failed intermittently and the check engine light came on bad o sensors twice probably the last audi ill ever buy  sad really
Audi,Comfort/Interior,s review car is the ultimate in luxury and
Audi,Engine/Performance,"german  muscle car dear car lovers iam fortunate to have owned over   new cars in the last  yearsxkrsallotusithis s is solid fastfun and the quality and looks of these new audis in my opinion is leaving bmws  behind slowly but surelyit seems these guys at edmunds are afraid to admit this"
Audi,Comfort/Interior,s review  i have always owned audis i traded in
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,"not close to an m wide console rubs my kneecap constantly navigation system not accessible by navigator  no moving map  just directions on a x screen for a  option  wifes  m gets  more mileage with same pickup  torquesteer on front wheels annoying harsh ride  gave back to dealer to sell with less than  miles on it  will keep m  a horrible car"
Audi,Engine/Performance,blazing speed this car is a  all around
Audi,Price/Value,an overrated audi audi should never even offer an automatic transmission in a car like thiseven the tiptronic  aside from being clunky after  miles mine has been in the shop going on  weeks because it will no longer shift gears  the right rear brake make an ear shattering squeal and they cant seem to fix that either  the brakes are awful on the smallest amount of ice or snow there is an unacceptable number of squeaks rattles and buzzes inside  and even though a small point two of the cup holders are underneath the armrestvery handy  i guess germans dont drink and drive for the price extreme disappointment is all i can say about this vehicle
Audi,Engine/Performance,low quality performer i couldnt be happier with the stock performance of this car the price to performance and features ratio of this car cant be beat and simple upgrades can make this car truly track ready in the northeast or snowy climes no car on the road can touch it b s and rs  aside but quality reliability and dealer service is absolutely brutal electrical system problems are audis specialty but i have also had problems with everything from rattles to rivets popping to coolant pumps failing to leather spalling to  service quality and knowledge from dealers is poor eg audi service does not feel its necessary to rotate tires
Audi,Price/Value,"rims and tires i love everything about the car but the rims and tires all wheel drive should be good up north not according to audi  they tell me to expect no more than  miles from these tires and i should change rims at least once a year at  a year that is not comfortable pirelli says if you can afford the car you can afford the tires check what you are willing to pay i have gone through  the stock tires are horrible in ice and snow"
Audi,Design/Style,s heaven this car is definitly the transportaion
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,simply the finest car on the road i dont care what anybody says audi has blown away mbz and bmw in the worst way with this car  there is nothing this car cannot do i can go in the snow without chains but smoke mustang cobras all day long at the same time  mileage is poor but if you are worried about mpg you have no business owning a car of this caliber  this is my rd audi and definately not my last  i have owned mbzs lexus and had much experience with beemers but this car embarrasses them
Audi,Engine/Performance,dr jeckill  mr hyde this car can be a street racer or a daily commuter and does both well  this was my first audi with an automatic  speed duel clutch transmission  i do not miss the manual and cannot think of buying another car without the duel clutch transmission  i was sorry to see that the  s is back to an  speed automatic because of the torque spikes of the new turbocharged  v  i have a  audi q on order  it has the duel clutch transmission
Audi,Comfort/Interior,"read before you buy i bought this car new last year for the first year i loved the car every aspect of it with small somewhat irritating problems wind blowing throw the windows on the highway right off the lot will drive you insane if you are listening to talk radio my s came with the upgraded summer tire package with the continental conti contact s these are the worst tires in the world the tread pattern wore out unusually after k miles seriouslythat is a like k option what a waste if you car has these tires make them change them before you buy"
Audi,Service/Maintenance,brake failure i bought the s because it is advertised as a track car by audi at their sports car experience at infineon raceway after a warm up session then  minutes on the track i had fade and then failure from my brakes at the dealership the rotors were determined to be bad i have owned so many cars  audis and never has this happened according to the dealership audi usa will not cover the brakes they put in my car how is it the ss they have you track at their raceway last but mine cannot this car is not for tracking since the manufacturer does not back up its product and treats loyal owners poorly truth in engineering failure to support customers
Audi,Price/Value,drives like a dream be prepared to study the manual
Audi,Service/Maintenance,never deal with audi last october my husband bought me a brandnew  q car as a gift from audi silver spring maryland  surprisingly in less than a month a sudden annoying beep repeatedly announcing an emergency call malfunction terrified usÂ  after contacting audi service they took the car on november thÂ  and promised to fix it in a day or two saying they know about  q car defect  this comment rang a bell in our mind  if they already know about it why audi sell it without fixing it  is this a fair trade  after more than  days later audi did not fix the carÂ  going back and forth finally audis service department told us that they could not fix the car becauseÂ a part was not received from germany  this was not just an irrational excuse but also a gross insult to us for spending overÂ sixtyseven thousand dollars on an audi car and receive such poor service  is this a fair trade  anyhow to solve this problem amicably i told audis manager either to give us a full refund or a new similar carÂ  the latter agreed to provide us a new similar car in a few days  alas audi did not fulfill its promise again Â for the benefit of doubt we gave audis manager a longer delay saying we are travelling and will be back aroundÂ mid januaryÂ  by then we expect you toÂ give us a similar car or aÂ full refundÂ  sadly audi did not fulfill its promise for the third time  by definition a brandnew car means a defectfree car  hiding the  q car defect is an act of misleading and dishonestyÂ Â this defect is known by audi and its dealership since some time  yet audiÂ did not tell us about it  thus audiÂ deceived us in selling this carÂ  plus our  q car is considered a lemon car by federal and state lawaudisÂ dealership knows that i am a science major and must concentrate on my studiesÂ  audi wasted our timeÂ for three months for no legitimate reason during which we were  and still are  paying installments interest and insurance on a car which we are not using since last november because it is in audis possessionÂ  audis dealership has frustrated us disappointed us caused us to suffer and denied us the enjoyment of using our own brandnew car  by any standard audis transaction is Â unethicalÂ andÂ unfairÂ  audis director of variable operations offered us his apology for causing us this ordealÂ  does he really think that hisÂ apology shall alleviate our suffering  based upon the aforesaid trouble we find it very difficult for us to trust audi anymoreÂ Â we honestly believe that if audi and its dealershipÂ care about their name business and reputation they must cancelÂ this dealÂ as well as itsÂ loan immediatelyÂ pay us a full refundÂ of our money including all interest insurance and installments we made
Audi,Price/Value,love it  hate it at same time  q t premium plus quatro  the car is luxurious holds the road great and even has a nice smooth ride sometimes  if your freeways are often like the freeways in los angeles be prepared to bounce like youre in a uhaul and its miserable  its amazing that such an expensive highend suv has such a disparity with the drive  at times its so smooth and comfortable and other times its bouncy and horrible  the head audi technician brought me a new identical car to the one we leased to test drive exactly where i frequent and it was the same  even he was baffled and disappointed as to the bounciness of the drive  just a side note its difficult to get into the car without your knee smashing into the dashboard if youre short  i am   and it took me a few bruises on the knee until i got used to carefully  slowly getting into the car as to not bash myself on the lower portion of the dashboard the cup holders are quite small and youll need to purchase coffee mugs with a narrow bottom diameter
Audi,Price/Value,vasco dealers will post a high price need to negotiate down a big percentage and checking nation wide the pricing of different dealers
Audi,Design/Style,stunning car for a lb beastie drivers middle column with stick shift is smallish in the way of compartments for your phones and keys and change mildly irritating the cars auto cruise control failed to see a red truck in front of me stopped at a red light and i had to hurry up to apply the brakes trust issues at this point rear hatch will not open by waving foot under sensor  out of  times had this car a month
Audi,Engine/Performance,brake problem seriously consider this i have a  q and the brakes squeal this sound has been present since we purchased it as a new vehicle we have called audi usa multiple times and they claim fault and have been absolutely useless to help us resolve this issue this is my second audi a and given the performance i was expecting this has been very disappointing with this type of service of a new vehicle be careful making an audi purchase i sense audi is just waiting for the brakes to wear out and charge us for new brakes anyone having a similar problem
Audi,Engine/Performance,engine stopstart drives me crazy one expects a  vehicle to be outstanding and the q deserves that merit except for  items  the engine stopstart feature cannot be permanently disabled like our  audi a  i have to remember to disengage this annoying feature every time i drive this vehicle  it is infuriating  the second item is the runflat tires  audi chose to save weight and space like many other companies by eliminating the spare tire   they commissioned a tire just for just this vehicle resulting in an extreme cost of  per tire  the last item is the jack  the audi engineers could not find space for the jack anywhere in the vehicle so it is unsecured in the rear cargo area making it a missile in the event of an accident  the rear compartment is filled with the bose stereo system and one would be hard pressed to get a toothbrush in there  i tried under the hood and it is just as crammed
Audi,Comfort/Interior,never again will i purchase or lease  audi ongoing brake squel audi says its normal sounds like i had the brakes are done at people boys how awful paint finish around grille area faded off after a year of car washing drivers side mirror whistles while driving  mph and above audi pre sense goes off whenever it feels and jerks seat belts even when no other vehicle around and likes to make our hearts jump to almost a heart attack worst vehicle ever for price we complain constantly and all audi says its normal normal normal  dollar waste should have bought the ford explorer at least ford would back there products unlike audi audi worst customer service and support just in  sunroof now making vibration noises wtf
Audi,Service/Maintenance,avoid this car the brakes squeak anytime the brake is touched  the dealer says  of owners are complaining  we have asked them to relay our dissatisfaction to audi  nothing gets done  the squeaking noise is like fingernails down a chalkboard  it is embarrassing to drive the car because of the noise  please do not buy this car  so disappointed in audis customer service
Audi,Service/Maintenance,beware of brake squeal issue do not buy i have a  q with  miles on it and there is a horable brake squeal that they know of the issue and have no fix in site so in audi usa words enjoy the car with the noisy brakes until they can find out what the issue is so i have a  car thats an embarrassment to drive i will never recommend aud the company does not stand behind there products
Audi,Comfort/Interior,look the other way beware  qs both terrible where should i start what a nightmare leased a brand new  in july of last year to make a very long and frustrating story short what a nightmare problems out of the get go from suspensioninterior and so on no support from audi at all just a brand new car  miles needing tons of repairs dealer decided to purchase the vehicle from us and being that the dealer stepedup to help us we decided to give it another try leased another  audi q carbon gray metallic premium plus with warm weather package which meant higher payment and another down payment not even  hours into the new q we had troubles with the supercharger should have known then it was not going to stop there center consoles get warped horrible design which leads into the terrible quality of the seats we leased a q with warm weather package due to heated ac seats hoping that these seats would wear better nope front driver  seat nd row seat and rd row seats all need replacement drivre side front window needs window regulator slow roll down and noisedrivers door has a pop sound which we have been trying to chase for  months have fun trying to close the doors x  oh and dont forget squeaky brakes around k miles still no fix in site for that  ours for some odd reason has a rough idle and the other day just decided to start shaking and feeling like it wanted to accelerate while foot was on brake yup vehicle is at the dealer currently audi customer supportservice no help and terrible  attitudes timing to get issues handled with audi is the worst being my first audi experience i would never ever do it again nor refer anyone to purchase or lease i can only hope this review will save someone else a huge headache  loss of money i just wait for this thing to break down again andor for the next interior part to break
Audi,Engine/Performance,watch out for the squeaky brakes know before you buylease
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,spend on whats important i have a few audis with all trim levels i opted for the  premium with cold weather and electronics package with nav and apple play the vehicle has so many electroniccontrol idiosyncratic problems that day to day use is not pleasant bluetooth functions poorly and makes its own choices as to wether it works or not the shifter is so odd its dangerous and putting the second row down is an operation its very large with somewhat poor visibility and poor gas mileage i have my rd a and that is close to the perfect car this is my last q
Audi,Engine/Performance,hesitation the q  has inconsistent hesitation upon acceleration  which is a safety concern when pulling into traffic  not a happy audi buyer
Audi,Engine/Performance,navigation sucks even more with use the navigation system is poor and confusing you have to manually change state location even if have driven there  the electronic handbrake can be activated while car is in gear  very dangerous map navigation systems poorly described  manual describes all options not what is available in that vehicle  very confusing after  months the confusion between map and navigation systems remains a major stupid problem
Audi,Comfort/Interior,in the shop  times for sunroofrattling issues poorly made  bad fit and finish in interior horrible rattling after only  mi god knows what this car will sound like a year from now this car was rushed to market not ready for primetime if you do not mind a car that will rattle over every bump then this is your car but if that sort of thing bothers you run dont buy
Audi,Price/Value,run flats wtf did you ruin a fantastic car i was considering it and it was my top choice until i found out they only come with run flats after my experience with run flats on a toyota i will never again own a car on run flats they ride poorly have no milage warranty last half as long as other tires and are expensive to replace sorry audi i love my a cabrio but will now buy someone elses car just because of the run flats
Audi,Comfort/Interior,dont spill your coffee and other issues cup holder still located above nav electronics  a minor spill will short out the systemabout a  repair  use a real mug for all beverages  gas cover no longer opens from inside  you must open the cover by pushing on it from the outside  in cold weather the cover freezes and is extremely hard to open  who thought that was a good idea
Audi,Engine/Performance,not totally german made currently i have k miles on the car and found out there was a major timing chain issue something i didnt expect on a luxury car fairly quiet cabin with obvious road noise from the factory tires and progressively get worse as tires wear out annoying rattle noise on the sunroof screen
Audi,Service/Maintenance,q  the worst the worst experience i v ever had  i leased  a brand new q  back in october   and i have taken the car back to them  times barke problems   from the first day i picked up the car windows making noise  wheel bearing problems wheel alignment and tires off balance smart key door opener not functioning  squeaking when u apply the brakes driver side and passenger side molding coming off tires making very loud noise  i have all my documents with  visits i had and finally the last visit they have hit my car in the service department and i have to tleave the car  week to get fix bumper and rear bumper light was broken the service manager is a nice guy but he came up to me saying  dear mr zahra this is all normal and it could happen to any car u buy what a brand new q   for the value of  and i have to expect this to be normal im sorry this is not normal at all my dear friend im very disappointed and very shocked
Audi,Engine/Performance,q  the  suv on the market this car has truly amazed me i thought there is no more surprise after driving amgs bmw series or the escalade even just jumping from a cayenne turbo to the audi well there is
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,jekyl and hydemobile  bridgestone tires that came on car the loudest tires ive ever owned they also ride like they are filled with concrete sunroof shattered at about  mi repair caused a leak that migrated to the back and damaged electronics all audi repairs radio failed at  mi along with the cd screen film on the windshield interior cannot be removed by any glass cleaner either we or audi have tried milky view of the world fuel consumption about  city and  hwy on premium car is terrible in snow and ice  poor traction under power or brakes
Audi,Engine/Performance,dont buy an audi important to note i am a grandma and a teacher i do not speed  i always take my car for service promptly  i am absolutely outraged with the quality of this car  i only have  miles and i need a new engine  how ridiculous is that  this vehicle has had many faults  one example is that emergency brake locked on me while i was driving on the freeway very scary   other defects window mechanism broken on both front windows molding coming off headlights fogged from inside bad brakes be awarethe bluebook price has drastically decreased fifty percent  overall  dont buy an audi  i wish i never did
Audi,Comfort/Interior,german junk despite meaningful priceincentive at purchase discount cant make up for poor quality and ongoing issues  brakes and tires needed replacing at k mi in response to which dealer congratulated me for outlasting the average most customers only get k out of both at best reason heavy weight  quickly upgraded tires they were pathetic in snowice  seems insane for an awd suv but had to stick with same lousy brakes due to some proprietary sensors anyone test this theory  sunroof rattles steering wheel vibrates at  mph nd row seat rattles like a year old chevy pickup  dealer happy to keep trying to fix but sick of driving a loaners
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,very disappointed very nice looking car but brakes have been squealing since the day i bought it resurfaced twice at k service told me i needed new brakes at the cost of k said they changed the warranty on brakes to k miles and i see why now neither audi nor dealership were helpful just basically said sorry from what i understand there have been many brake problems in this vehicle brakes still squeal terrible customer service from audi headquarters and dealership and obviously do not stand behind their vehicles it is a fun car to drive but for the  money i spent you would expect high quality and customer service fuel economy bad even for an suv do not buy this vehicle
Audi,Engine/Performance,a little disappointed this is my rd audi  i have owned an a and currently still own an a  i am disappointed in the reliability and quality of the q  i have only  miles on this car and brakes are already going  the tires also need to be replaced  i have never owned a vehicle where the brakes and tires went bad at such low mileage  the engine sounds like it is struggling all of the time and is sounding more and more like a pickup truck and not an audi suv  we spent the extra money for the keyless start and it doesnt work when it is cold out  i think the quality of audis have definitely decreased
Audi,Design/Style,good engineering poor customer service i enjoy driving the q and it is a well built basic suv unfortunately for k price tag audi falls short on customer service and attention to detail i had serious electrical problems the st week i drove out of dealership and the dealers reaction was so what  they fixed it but it was as if it was expected  next the battery died several times and had to be jumpstarted  after bringing it in  times audi finally figured out the software had a glitch the mmi systemelectronic brain is unsealed and located below the tilted forward cup holders so if you spill even a little liquid on the shifter the mmi shorts out and it costs  to fix audi said not their design flaw my fault
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,wish i wouldve done my homework like many of you i fell in love with the q ive had it a year heres my issues electrical system went out brains of the car fuel gage failed  tire flat tires within  year also had the same problem as someone earlier as a very small amount of liquid spilled next to the drink cups it shorted my system to the tune of  love the car and hate the car at the same time
Audi,Comfort/Interior,silence is golden  my audi q has been the nicest drive for handling comfort and acceleration but the electronics have failed since about  weeks after i brought it home when it doesnt work it doesnt work no gps phoneradio cd ipod nothing and this was at the same time the steering column got stuck in the down position while setting my preferred settings i lowered it it stayed there for a month or so the service dept fixed it but the rest is a on going mystery
Audi,Comfort/Interior,seriously bad third row what third row you mean you can actually get in it a child could wiggle in when the rd row is up that it no space left for the length of this car where has all the space gone as for auto trunk lid i broke it within  minutes seriously yes i know i should have read all the instructions but i dont expect guests and friends to have read the manual to properly operate the auto trunk lid this is a huge car with all the space used by the front half while we were buying it for the rear half our mistake please dont make the same one
Audi,Comfort/Interior,impractical rd row when you are spending in the range of  to  you deserve comfort i am quite disappointed with the rd row first the nd row glide rail is not flush mounted nd getting in to rd row is nearly impossible since seat does not retract fully rd there is no room for even feet between two rows also no dvd player option
Audi,Comfort/Interior, miles and still ticking the cupholders are placed in a terrible location making spills into the navigation controls inevitable as they are located just below the cupholders  even a minor spill into the system causes it to short out  i have already replaced two and it looks like i have another problem  the electronics should be better insulated to allow for occasional spills  better yet move the cupholders to a less vulnerable locationfor the second time i am experiencing rips in the leather seating  i have never had this problem with other cars including my year old beetle with leather seats  and no i dont carry knives or screwdrivers in my back pockets  just had to replace the battery which is located under the passenger side front seat which needs to be removed to get to the battery compartment  ridiculously expensive for labor  audi wanted around  for replacement  had it done at my local foreign car repair shop for   replacing brakes is incredibly expensive even when done at my repair shop
Audi,Price/Value,disappointed i purchased my q october   loved it for the first  yearsoctober  things started to go wrong i drive a lot of highway miles so it was out of warrantythe lane side assist went out the latch for the rear moonroof broke  for a latch  in november  the heat went out only on the drivers side then both motors on the mirros went out at a cost of over  eachit is now january   i am still dealing with heat issues after spending  in repairs it still doesnt work properly sometimesnot at allnow my remote is beginning to faili have spent the last  months dealing with failures  expensesim done will never buy audi again
Audi,Engine/Performance,noisy engine the reliability has been poor the worst of any vehicle a have owned had to tow it to the dealer in my first week of ownership the engine just stopped running front bearing gone at  km driver door keeps dropping it has been fixed  times other problems way too many frustrating i find the v quite noise even below  rpm makes more  noise than my brother in law ford escape dealer service could be better
Audi,Design/Style,disappointed love the car except the electronics console buttons shorted out from windex used to clean off finger prints really bad design as the buttons are not sealed and will short out with only a couple of drops  audi will not stand behind cost  to replace in the first  months afraid to use the cup holders that are located above the elect  drops and another  pule the hassle want my range rover back
Audi,Service/Maintenance,disappointed my husband purchased this car for me and traded in our a cab for it i loved it at first then a month into ownership the trunk latch broke it wouldnt close all the way so i had to drive the hour away to the nearest dealership twice to get it fixed  weeks ago my mmi system stopped working and it was stuck to only play cds i took it in today and was told youre out of luck because you spilled something on it had i known this was such a common problem i wouldnt have bought this car now i have to shell out the money out of pocket to replace the mmi system after reading a bunch of reviews it seems to be an extremely common problem
Audi,Comfort/Interior,car seat in the center rear i love the car but am so disappointed that with a britax diplomat infant rearfacing seat one of the smallet most narrow on the market installed in the center position the safest i can only use one of the two adjacent seats the other is unusable because you cannot access the seat belt buckle  even in my old a wagon this was not a problem further with a carseat in the center location it is impossible to move the seats forward to access the third row you can move the carseat to the left or right but then your two rear passengers imagine grandma and grandpa are squished together and the one in the center has a very small seat this is a silly problem to have in an suv
Audi,Service/Maintenance,bad decision have driven lr x and q q just doesnt seem to be the same qualitymany problems  breaks wear out extremely quickly rear lift gate problems twice mpg is not as advertised based on my calcs nterior feels cramped ergonomically uncomfortable teen kids keep asking when can we get a new suvwe end up driving our bmw sedan to local ski resorts beachescant wait for lease to be over
Audi,Comfort/Interior,a lot of time in the shop at the last minute we signed a lease on this car thinking we would pay it off at the end of the lease term the first two years we had it it was in the shop every other month there was a problem with the ac and they kept breaking other things trying to fix it by the time it was stabilized i hated the car  i love the way it drives and the way it looks but i did not pay all this money to put it in the shop and drive a hyundai  we are eager to turn it in and put this experience behind us we will most likely be going back to toyota or volvo  i felt like the interior had a lot of plastic parts for the price   allinall my first luxury car did not turn out to be so luxurious
Audi,Service/Maintenance,never purchase a q the q is just an average suv the electronics are really bad and confusing maintenance and repair costs are very high
Audi,Price/Value,audi q prestige tire and maintenance are very expensive
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,front interior im frustrated with the layout of the center consolei have to take my eye off the road to use the radionavigation mmi controlsalso the same with the cup holders as they are too far backvoice control doesnt understand my commands or maybe i dont understand what to sayradio knob is out of the way and when out of my usual territory it is difficult to find a radio stationthe cruise control is visually difficult to seei dont like the wiper system as when i turn them on the rear wipers seem to go on too due to its location on the stickvehicle has a lot of road noisei thought id get better fuel mileage with the diesel but am only getting  mpg on the highway
Audi,Engine/Performance,almost there very comfortable and responsive but feels heavy and the turning radius is not great
Audi,Service/Maintenance, al has some lemons to admit and resolve audi is building a few hopefully lemons and attempting to outrun their flawed automobiles with marketing dollarsa search of the audi forums disclose a number of late model al vehicles with similar problems and alack of acknowledgement by audi that they intend to stand behind their warranteesaudi is intimidating dealers directing them to not service the car or refusing to pay them for warrantee repairsseat sensor  airbag deactivation mirror heat not workingtranny hard downshift radio station refresh cell phone pairing failsconsole rattle door closelocks malfunction when cold clunk on accelerationmmi system fails to play wav and flac files int lighting flickers
Audi,Engine/Performance,extended warranty required the germans have created cars with the philosophy that performance is the measure of quality they have forgotten that durability and reliability are paramount to quality anyone who buys a used audi a without an extended warranty will soon find the purchase economically untenable the electrics rival those of s british autos these cars are mechanically electrically and economically a nightmare the worst part of the experience is how arrogant they are about it
Audi,Engine/Performance,"rattles i would not purchase the car againthe car rattles badly the dealer admits to the rattles privitely but admits they cant fix themthe car has been in the shop for so many days i lost countother problems included multiple electronic failures gas gauge failure acceleration override problems where the engine management system retards acceleration when you move quickly from the brake to the  accelerator before the brake pedel contacts a relay that allows the accelerator to engage no help from audi to correct the problem has been forthcoming in spite of dealing with high level customer service personel"
Audi,Price/Value,most expensive pos audi i ever bought i bought  audi a back of  ever since then i have problem with this carstarted with tire pressure coming on for no reasonother issue battery always discharging completely even nothing onthis car is probably the worst car out thereif anyone thinking buying oneyou better think againi did some research with this car before i bought itthey have desame issue im having since i got iti should listen to other peopleunless you willing to be at shop every week and spend alot of money audi a pso thats the  letters for this carbewarenever going buy audi again

Audi,Service/Maintenance,audi company ihave owned a  a and  a and the basic cars work very well but i am very disappointed in audi company in their technical service department and also with the national sales teammy a was having a electrical mechanicalissue with the relay that controls the power brake systemmy understanding is thataudi technical support instructed the local audi mechanic to wrap insulation around the relay so i would not hear the relay closing and opening the next item was to relocated the relay to another spot in the car so i would not hear the relay both of this approaches did not address the core issue of the problem why is the relay started working that way instead it appears that audi was trying to mask the issue hope the owner would go away this is very serious problem with this car and i would not aspect audi would try to cover up of the issuethe next point is that i ask the local sales manager to see what audi would do for a trade value on my car towards a newer one the answer he give was that audi would not help out in this matter besides not fixing the issueneedless to say that the way audihas handle this matter is very disappointingfor a company that is trying to make inroads in the high end market

Audi,Price/Value," audi wagon  i had wanted an audi wagon for awhile  i did a lot of research on the car  i did finally end up purchasing one and overall i have enjoyed driving it some issues that i have sadly encountered are i had to have a new transmission after owning it for  month the sunroof has an awful vibration unless the two back windows are rolled down some if you purchase the sport package as i did the tires create a lot of wind noise"
Audi,Engine/Performance,"not so overwhelmed i think part of the problem is that i had built this car up in my head during the  month period i was waiting to receive delivery of itthe t although peppy required a chip to satisfy me my older vr put a much bigger grin on my face other than that the car has really loosed up quite a bit which is very disappointing for a  car with all the tricks and german engineering"
Audi,Design/Style,very disappointed i bought this car new maintained it to spec have had repeated problems including the radio failed temperature sensor failed twice led display is failing outside temp sensor is flaky today my dealer told me to service a zillion more things and quoted the repair bill at  no way this for a  year old car with about  miles get real im never buying an audi every again they even design it badly for maintenance  its a nightmare to service  so the labor charges add up quickly  in contrast my acura never needed anything special  its back to the japanese in a few months for me
Audi,Engine/Performance,horrible engine  horrible company i bought my  a t when it was  years old with k miles on it i loved it for a while  great snow car but at k the timing belt failed and ruined the engine audi refuses to do anything to help and i was out k for a new engine finally traded it in
Audi,Service/Maintenance,dont waste your money i leased my  audi a t quattro sedan new it was great for the first year since then it has been in the shop with multiple problems at least every other month ive been to four audi service centers and each one does a worse job than the other audi customer service didnt seem to care either im finally fed up with the car and contacted audi of north america for details on turning it in earlythey finally want to talk but its too late we also have had two volkswagen jettas with similar problems i wouldnt recommend an vwaudi product
Audi,Comfort/Interior, a i havent had any problems with the car other than rear wheel bearings and front tie rod ends
Audi,Engine/Performance,t bad engine design the cars great when it works but after all the problems the world knows about with the ignition coils it also has a bad oil filtration system and timing belt tensioner  read the bulletin boards for huge repair bills and horror stories of oil pumps seizing and engine belts falling off  mine went through two oil pumps and found out the valves needed replacing  all of which audi refuses to pay for  bad engine bad company  they tried to make it right when it was small stuff like the coils but now that its big engine bills theyre stone walling it  these turbo engines can only run on synthetic oil  yet the dealers have strict instructions otherwise on leased cars bad
Audi,Price/Value,"not worth it i have a  mustang that has less problems  nothing but electrical problems since ive had it  abs unit needed to be replaced twice without a warning lightthats comforting control box for door locks had to be replaced couldnt even get in the car most recently had to have all dashboard electronics replaced after radio froze couldnt change stations or anything and dash disply went dead  if you have to have one lease and not for longer than the warranty"

Audi,Price/Value,buy an acura instead do yourself a favor and buy an acura
Audi,Service/Maintenance," audi a  i bought this car a week ago and  day later the radio buttons went out a headlight wire was loose and the cupholder needed to be replaced because it stuck  the radio was also replaced i wonder what is next and am afraid to take it on a long trip for fear something will stop working"
Audi,Engine/Performance,"buyer beware ive only owned the car for a few months and have had it die on me twice  all  audis have faulty engine coils mine have broken twice already and supposedely have now all been replaced with new nonfaulty coils in the process a tow truck ripped off my front spoiler and i fought with them for over two moths for replacement compensation my dealership was unsympathetic and useless i bought the car based on reliability and customer service i have found both to be completely lacking and unsatisfactory  never buy an audi without the original warranty remaining instead go buy a lexus or acura thats what ill be doing next"
Audi,Price/Value,i can not recomend this car  miles
Audi,Engine/Performance,"dont buy this car i bought a  a in sept of  and it has given me nothing but problems  in a little over a year i have had a laundry list of problems ranging from engine problems cylinder coil faulty oil pump problems with the turboetc to safety problems faulty air bag to just plain annoying problems like a leak in my rear windshield leak in the washer fluid system bad cd player buttons on the console that stopped working and an ashtray that doesnt open  it seems ive been driving a rental more than my own car if i wanted to drive a ford escort i would have bought one dont buy an audi"
Audi,Engine/Performance,get extended warranty its fun to drive kinda slow for you speed freaks theres a blind spot when the top is up also had to replace my tranny at  miles yes  miles past warranty expiration they paid for half i think they should have paid for all now i am finding out they do not hold their value at all very expensive car to drive wont ever buy an audi again the navi ui stinks and is very confusing
Audi,Design/Style,the worst car i have ever owned the a audi cabrolet was a disaster from the start between the cars computer problems brake and the accelerator not coordinated correctly windows not closing as designed timer not resetting top not going down or up etc audi is a bad choice for a car of your dreams not only did audi fail to fix the problems audi   was useless they sided with the dealers on most everything audi would not let me meet an audi rep to go over my concerns they blame almost everything on owner abuse there are too many other things that didnt work to mention think twice before you buy an audi unless you have deep pockets and enjoy the mental stress of dealing with a bottom line company
Audi,Price/Value,this car sucks dont buy it t t t t t t t t                               t    t               tttt                  t                       t                    tttt       t  ttt                 t t        t   t             t t     t t t t          t       t tt                     t   t                    tt         t      t  t t  t                       t t
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,awful awful awful i have replaced the crank shaft the ac compressor the fuel injector pump tires twice in  years im a girl  i dont ride this car hard at all the air intake headlights x  there are an insane amount of headlights in this car  i would have been better off and happier riding the bus
Audi,Design/Style,i believe  audi in bmw backyard i wanted to start driving a manual trans again but could not find one that i really like with wd  then after the as that i test drove i settled for this one  black on black
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,buyers beware ive owned this car for  months and its been in the shop getting repaired for over  months  replaced the computer fuel tank burned out lights coolant leaks trunk latch broke seat belt switch fuel injectors leaking fuel everywhere  im tired of driving a rental car around   times in the shop for repairs costing me several hundred dollars from missing time at work to deal with these problems dont buy
Audi,Engine/Performance,dont trust audi warranty there is no doubt that the a has been fun to drive and the quattros performance is unmatched  but after driving the car for  years it has become very loose with all kinds of interiorexterior noises  my brakes rotors are already warped and audi service and customer care are telling me that it is not covered under warranty because of outside influences stemming from overheating caused by riding on the brakes and braking too hard  this seems like a lame excuse not to cover damage to brakes caused by normal driving
Audi,Engine/Performance,alright my experience so far has been a negative one one month with the car and an engine belt breaks off meaning  weeks of labor an extra two months into the car and the left tail light went off lately the airbag sign came on not to mention that the ignition key battery is already dead
Audi,Engine/Performance,can audi build a car that is too good the answer is yes i ordered my audi a t quattro sedan on  arrived on  i ordered mine loaded with navigation bose w sirius radio speed manual wsport cold weather lighting  sunshade pkgs i opted against tire pressure monitoring pain in the butt i waited a long time for this car but it has exceeded my expectations i have been told i have a permanent grin when behind the wheel everything the t lacked in interior equipment engine power and looks has been addressed in its redesign i get  mpg hwy  city i drove the bmw series awd in the snow and found myself going down down my hill sideways the audi quattro reigns supreme
Audi,Comfort/Interior,epa mileage is way off we had a  a prior to this one and i think i like that one better this car is very stylish and has a classy interior to me it feels like a  car real solid however i cant stand the center console its positioned so that my leg room is restricted and makes driving almost a miserable experience i thought i can get over it but so far with  miles i hate it way to uncomfortable gas mileage is horrible my other audi was incredible with mpg but this one is worse than a suv seriously its very disappointing im taking it to the dealer soon but audi has never been famous for their customer service lease these cars only and give them back before the warranty expires
Audi,Service/Maintenance,"not living up to expectations i have to admit when i purchased the a it was my first car over   over  really  but i needed  doors needed wd and was tired of the suv ride  after six months the build quality of this car is absolutely terrible  i am totally surprised that sources like edmunds keep recommending this car and vws  its my fault if i had read half of the discussion groups etc before i bought i never would have touched it  the last time i took it in for the rd injector replacement all  bays had newer audis in them  this is also a porshe and subaru dealer  when i mentioned it to the service manager he just shook his head and said exhausted you have no idea"
Audi,Service/Maintenance,take warning this car is worthless  the electrical
Audi,Comfort/Interior,too much technology you need a phd to drive this car  the manual is difficult to read so if you have a button good luck finding it in the manual  it has a control panel that is complicated to find the entry you need  so for example to program the garage door opener you need to go through about  steps which are not intuitive and difficult to find  the volume on my gps suddenly disappeared  it took me days of fooling with the manual to figure out how to get it back on and i still dont understand how it disappeared  i had the windshield repaired and the technician moved the steering wheel  it took me a week to figure out how to move the steering wheel  there is little foot room in the rear seats  the leather  seats are cheap looking  the audi dealer gave me a  minute training session when i bought the car which didnt help matters  you can blame this on a female but my husband has had no more luck than i in figuring out this car   i am really disappointed in this car
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,dont even think to get it very poor technology they lie to you saying this mmi bull dont buy that if you have a flat tire the car is not even able to show you that imagine the rest
Audi,Design/Style,audi loses a customer for  i drive a  audi a  recently the programmable radio buttons and mmi began to malfunction  i brought it in for service expecting a repair under warranty and was told that the problem was likely due to liquids spilling onto the buttons not covered by the warranty  i would tend to agree with this diagnosis because the radio buttons are positioned directly next to the cup holders  it is almost impossible to avoid spilling liquid into the buttons because of this design  even the motion of the car with a cup of liquid in the holder could easily cause liquid to spill into the radio buttons  nevertheless this is clearly a design flaw with the center console  i have been a computer engineer since  therefore my ability to recognize a user interface design issue is my business  but it doesnt take an engineer to recognize the poor design of the center console  i contacted audi customer support audicustomerexperiencecenteraudicom and after waiting almost two months the customer service rep never bothered to provide a final response  instead i had to escalate searching the internet for another way to contact audi who agreed to cover only the parts  but not the labor costs   i did not accept this offer because the design of the center console is the cause of this issue because its inevitable that liquid will spill into the radio buttons given that they are positioned right next to the cup holder  so there you have it  audi has decided to lose a customer for  over what in my opinion and experience is a design flaw  this is my second a  the cup holder of the  a was not positioned next to the radio buttons  in  audi changed the console and created this problem
Audi,Engine/Performance,dont buy an audi  these are nice looking cars but dont be fooled thats the end of the benefit  our audi had a complete engine failure and heard from many people that had frequent expensive repairs  im so disappointed with these cars what an awful experience
Audi,Design/Style,black beauty
Audi,Comfort/Interior,bad luck or actual crap of a vehicle we bought this car for my kid the car had k miles which isnt much from the reviews i have read on this vehicle  butafter owning it for less than  weeks it was in the shop   months later i stuck over three grand into this vehicle and it wont stop breaking  it seems like as soon as i fix one thing another one breaks i am ready to take it to auction
Audi,Price/Value,my audi i got the car with  miles and put an extra  in the past two years and i cant imagine anyone having as many problems with a car than i had very expensive to repair the smallest stuff the acceleration is horrible but i love the handling and brakes i like how the lights light up a lot and love the heated seats everyone complains about the zero room in the back cant stand the buttons always jamming in the cold cheap
Audi,Engine/Performance,dont buy this car i bought my audi a t in  new over the last  years of ownership and  miles i have had to replace different sensors on the engine  different times the last just  weeks ago at  for two oxygen sensors just  days later i was in audi service again for a hose that needed to be ordered and a total of  would be needed i was so mad i sent my audi to the used car auction i also had to replace brake pads every  miles i thought this was also unreasonable i averaged between  and  a year for maintenance and have decided this car is not worth owning
Audi,Comfort/Interior,expensive electrical problems we previously owned  audi a awd  years ago  we have been astonished by the frequency and cost of expensive repairs  our airbag controller and brake controller have failed each costing  to repair  we have developed an oilleak costing  to repair  the bumper scratches incredibly easily and ends up looking terrible  the interior trim is coming apart  netnet though a very pretty and comfortable car that is fun to drive the cost of ownership is far beyod what one would expect  we will never buy another audi
Audi,Service/Maintenance," a tq  problems after k mi in months  audi replaced the front brakes a cv boot numerous headlights  the dash instrument cluster in months  since the warranty has expired i have had numerous problems including vacuum hoses ac clutch radio hazard flasher drivers inner door assembly  about  outofpocket the dealer suggested an extended warranty should a k car be breaking down less than six months out of warranty consumer reports rates this car as a car to avoid for reliability as an entry level car its not good pr i may try acura rltl bmw series lexus is or mercedes cclass for the same money"
Audi,Service/Maintenance,"disappointed i love my audi a t but sadly it is a lemon  of course i find out it is a lemon after the warrantyi will never buy another a because the dealership where i purchased it will not take any responsiblity  i have taken it in several times and all i hear is the fact that they have never seen an audi with so many problems  apparently the audi corporation does not stand behind their product either  it is a shame because it is such a fun little car"
Audi,Engine/Performance,what i think of the  audi a  qua automatic transmission shifting erratic and could be dangerous as the vehicle dies when accelerating from  mph to road speed dealer claims thats the way it is
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,dont buy this car the  audi a is no longer a good buy i am on my third and the changes to the steering have made this car a poor buy the steering has become loose and numb and when driving past  you feel has if you have no control of the car the  turbo also bangs constantly at low speeds and if your try to accelerate fast all you get is a pedal of air driving this car used to be fun but has become typical of an american car with too much over steer and lack of initial power the mileage is nowhere  but rather a  overall and the company suggests premium gas buy a volkswagen jetta instead
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,nothing but problems i purchased a used  audi a gorgeous car but underneath nothing but mechanical issues im a realist and understand that these things happen but its the response of audi and parker audi that made it worse unfortunately my vehicle was plagued with the all too well known oil consumption issue my car was still under the extended warranty so i could gave gotten the problem diagnosed and hopefully resolved free of charge but my local audi dealer did not give me any confidence that resolving the oil consumption issue was going to happen if anyone is in the market for a used audi a do yourself a favor and research audi a oil consumption issue extensively before making your purchase and save yourself the headache i went through i will never touch another audi after this and its stemmed from the bad customer service i received from audi
Audi,Engine/Performance,a piece of crap if you are thinking and going to purchase an audibeware this audi a quattro has nothing short but a daytime nightmare for me when i purchased this vehicle in april the car had  miles on it and the car was good at  i found out the oil consumption issue which was an oil separator kit and the dealer fixed it for free at  the turbocharger went bad and the dealer replaced the turbocharger that costs  which i had to pay on march   a day in which i will never forget the car failed to start when i was ready to leave work on one of the coldest days of the year and when the car was towed to the shop the dealer said the engine was no good the diagnosis was the timing chain jumped a tooth casing damage to the cylinder head timing chain and tensioner which will cost  to fix this was a major problem audi knew about and having the consumer pay for it is absurd  i joined a class action lawsuit against audi of america because i have read different posts about this issueaudis are great cars to drive but when major problems occur they are nothing but huge money pits
Audi,Price/Value,a is a total lemon  wish we didnt by the audi this car has been a total lemon it is constantly in the shop with one expensive repair after another the audi dealership in raleigh also makes it even worse lexus provides a much better experience when we bring in our cars there
Audi,Engine/Performance,great looking car  reliable not so much i bought the car certified pre owned in  with k miles on it before k the oil light kept coming on took it to the dealer who said it was normal to use a lot of oil cause its a turbo took it back to the dealer when we had to start putting a quart or more of oil in every  miles they had to go thru a  step process to prove the car had an oil consumption problem which involved  visits to the shop over the course of the better part of a year they finally had to basically rebuild the top half of the engine this was around k miles fast forward to just over k miles and the timing chain tensioner failed car was of course just out of warranty and despite technical bulletins on the issue and a class action lawsuit the audi dealership didnt cut us any slack on the repair quote over k to rebuild the engine or k for a new one we took it to a rd party shop and managed to get the work done for a mere k the ignition coils have failed  times in the last year random lights keep failing fuel pump went bad at k miles car is now just around k miles and has multiple epc faults idles rough and randomly dies at low speeds its been in the shop  times in the last  months still not fixed this is without a doubt the worst vehicle ive ever owned i once drove a  ford ltd in the s that was more reliable i would never buy another audi and the only reason im still attempting to drive this one is its paid off except for the repair bills those keep coming
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,t oil consumption solutions a review to all those having oil consumption problems i bought my  a t about a year ago off of a lease with about k on it i was sick of bringing it to the dealer where i purchased it from for a top of because of the oil min light it is not normal switched my servicing to another audi dealer in the dc area and they learned that my turbo and pistons were not made up to par with what my car required something about a bad batch both my turbo and all oil parts were just replaced in hopes that it will solve the problem and will cause less oil to be burned without necessityas long as you are persistant they will fix the problem just dont bring it to a dbag dealer
Audi,Engine/Performance,disappointed audi owner i am so very disappointed in the performance of my  audi a june   with mileage at  km i replaced both front wheel bearings and hubs at a cost of  then on june   km pad wear sensor had a broken wire this required new front pads and rotors even though there was still available wear on the original pads this problem cost i have previously owned two subaru outbacks which i drove well over the  km mark neither required this type of extensive expensive repairhaving to replace front wheel bearings at such low mileage doesnt seem reasonable to me is this something audi as experience as the normdisappointed
Audi,Design/Style,owned for less than  miles the cvt was not a responsive transmission like we thought it should bethe car was tastefully designed but the radio horrible to try to useloved the exterior design but way overpriced with a cvt
Audi,Engine/Performance,disappointed just bought a new  a with at found the steering too light and steering doe not return to neutral after a turn at normal speed this requires more attention and correction from driver making the car unpleasant if not unsafe to drive acceleration is acceptable but fuel economy is bad for  highway and  light local driving i averaged only mpg thats what i get for my  v accord also find the controls unfriendly and complicated to use
Audi,Engine/Performance,steering problem after a turn the steering wheel does not return to straight properly too slow which makes driving a bit nerve racking and seemed unsafe
Audi,Price/Value,bad investment purchase vehicle at  miles had to replace the top because back window fell out x  the first ignitor went bad   the second ignitor went bad   the third one went bad and i replaced the balance at  miles the rack and pinion seals went bad leaking oil how to replace whole system for  so in the past year i had to spend  for a new top  for a new rack and pinion steering system  for igniters and  for tires the total is  which i could have put on a new car and the bad part was even though it was under a  day warranty the dealership would not even help covering the cost of the top or anything else we have since gone to the attorney general in massachusetts to help the next guy not getting stuck by a supposing reputable car dealer
Audi,Engine/Performance,rough ride great engine handling and transmission unfortunately the suspension is so hard it transmits every bump and crevice from the road right to the steering wheel and cabin  makes for a nervous ride  truly unfortunate  i feel like i need to see the chiropractor after every drive
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,multiple expensive failures before k miles purchased car just off lease at approx k miles  car was always maintained by dealer while on leasemy wife is the primary driver doing a  mile rt work commute car is maintained in accordance with or more frequently than  factory guidelinesoverall a great car to drive but big but the greatness is negated by the following repairs performed by an audi dealerfactory piston tolerance defect resulting in excessive oil consumption  repaired at audis expense not the case for all a owners only after repeated inquiries to dealer and audi usa turbo failure   k miles  ktransmission leak k miles orings around cable plug  exhaust system union clamp inexplicably split not due to physical damage and not a routine repair item  part not available for  daysthermostat   k  had to replace whole water pump assemblydashboard lcd panel failure k miles the above is in addition to all of the routine maintenance oil changes filters battery performed by an audi dealer always at a premium or borderline ridiculous pricein summary  hugely disappointed in the repair frequency types of failures and related expense for a supposedly wellengineered car
Audi,Engine/Performance,find me a few tires i bought the car brand new after trading in my i i love the quattro but i cant keep tires on it discount tire tells me that the alignment is always out no matter where i take it i still have problems pep boys blames the tires and discount blames pep boys its really frustrating the car does have some turbo lag but not all the time it usally happens when you catch a stop light turning from red to green and you stomp on it it doesnt happen all the time and i dont believe its dangerous like a few reviews state the car is zippy and loves the highway i cruise at  mph no problem through arizona i will sometimes put extra oil in it between changes no reason to complain
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,research before buying  burns oil i love the turbo love the car however i have  very large issue it burns oil as you can read in others reviews and if you search the web this thing drinks oil and audi says it is normal and will do nothing about it i too carry a quart in the trunk and keep a case in the garage i have had the consumption test done however  quart every  miles is acceptable for audi even service guys at the  audi dealers i get my car serviced at admit it is a fairly common complaint but they are not authorized to do anything not every car has this problem but audi is not doing everything it can to retain loyal buyers who have bad ones i am sad that i will never buy an audi again
Audi,Design/Style,dont buy this car traded in my bmw for the a t  big mistake  the a is ho hum boring to drive no power cant handle a turn biggest mistake i ever made buying the a  audi is dreaming if they think their a t compares to a bmw ride im miserable with the a
Audi,Engine/Performance,new transmission when we test drove the vehicle we did not notice the hesitation when accelerating from a stop  mainly because we did not encounter any situation where we needed to hurry into or across an intersection  after purchase and we began to drive the vehicle under normal conditions the hesitation was scary  the engine rpm was increasing but the car was not going  the dealer told it that it was the new transmission  therefore nothing has been done to correct the problem pretty junky for such a renowned and expensive car  month later the radio dies and the replacement is junky
Audi,Engine/Performance,burning oil i have to take my car in every  to  miles to have oil put in because the car is burning the oil so fast this is my rd audi and i purchased this one under the assumption it would be like my others oil change every  miles i was wrong the dealership keeps telling me this is normal and i dont believe them ive contacted a lawyer because i want my car fixed before it goes out of warranty and find myself needing to replace a  engine
Audi,Engine/Performance,thumbs down on the a   sedan i have been real disappointed with the a  cvt i had  quattro before and there is no companison quattros are what audi is all about the cvt transmission is jerky in the  it is a boring ride i once tried to accelerate and had a delayed response it is fast and comfortable but i plan to get rid of it and go back to a quattro
Audi,Engine/Performance,dont buy an audi several issues with the vehicle    engine noise  the car sounds like a diesel not quiet it will bother you  dealer says that is the injectors   brand new car that burns oil according to audi corp the engineering tolerances allow for a quart to be burned every  miles   all i can say is wow  this is a serious problem that will cause engine failure in the future   the hid lights vibrate  taken in on several occasions there is an ntsb release on this safety issue  audi wont do anything about it till someone dies   poor value poor resale value   turbo lag     turbo lag  step on the gas pedal and count  missisippi  god forbid you need to quickly accela
Audi,Comfort/Interior,horrible junk i purchased a new a quattro on the way home the esp light would intermittently stay on the dynamic headlight warning light came on and stayed on the cruise control did not work the next morning i pulled out of the garage and began driving to work the same thing happened and got worse the turn signals would not work as well very poor car i have immediate glitches hassles embarassment pulled up at starbucks with coworker in car and had to open the door to get the order and this is all on the original tank of gas
Audi,Engine/Performance,engine failed after  miles the engine on my a developed a knock on the passenger side  audi has replaced the air pump ecu and is now replacing the cylinder head  i am concerned that such a new motor has failed and that audi has instructed the dealer to break it open and repair it rather then replace the motor or vehicle
Audi,Service/Maintenance,hard starting since september of  this car has been returned to the dealer for a total of approximately  weeks to try to fix a serious mechanical problem  namely extremely hard starting in cold weather  based on audis suggestions a number of the cars components including the coils and exhaust valves have been replaced but the problem has been neither identified or fixed  the car has currently been at the dealer for almost  weeks with no progress
Audi,Engine/Performance,audi aq t my new  a already been the shop  times  need a new engine   miles  very unreliable machine  very unhappy customer  would not buy audi again  idle rough at morning start  dealer said it is normal for all t
Audi,Comfort/Interior,ding dong the witch is dead i just had the misfortune of renting this car for a week  wow what a jokei had the base model with the sline package and a few extras like navigationthe car was wholly unpleasant to drive  the cvt an obvious annoyance the interior instrumentation and controls utterly mediocre and old fashioned  it wasnt antiquated like a subaru but it seemed like a step down from even a vw which is inexcusable for the costeverything about the driving experience made me completely puzzled as to why anyone would cross shop with this a similarly priced bmw  series and pick this audiim not a bmw fanboy or anything but the two vehicles are incompatible in driving experience and yet they are about the same price  audi is supposed to be the premium arm of vw and yet frankly this car is so easily bested in this segment by so many alternativesthank goodness that the  model is a complete redesign
Audi,Price/Value,why audi why after  years my beloved a passed on to another plane of existence i had always planned to buy another audi when the time came i didnt buy this car because for some reason this audi cant do what my much less expensive vw can do i want to connect my phone to my car via bluetooth and not only get phone calls but also my music waze spotify etc to play through the speakers i cant do this in the audi unless i purchase the much more expensive package or plug my phone in to a cord in the glove box no just no also cvt transmissions are crap and forced me into a more expensive quattro to avoid them who doesnt want to feel the car shifting who likes cvt transmissions also the back seats dont fold down theres not even a ski sack like my  had so theres no option for a bit more room  i did not buy the audi i wanted so badly to buy the audi but i just couldnt do it i bought a mercedesbenz instead im hoping audi gets it right in the next several years
Audi,Engine/Performance,the wanderer very disappointed with steering  on straight roads and at speeds over mph the car is all over the road  you will need to work hard on a long trip to keep it on track  i had the car brought in right away to princeton audi  the result  they said that the steering is within correct limits  my conclusion is this is either a very poor design by audi or princeton audi service is incapable of correcting the problem  my advice make sure to test drive at speed over mph before purchasing
Audi,Engine/Performance,a disappointment the good points the ride and handling are great the convertible top design is a delightthe bad everything is going to cost you more within  miles of driving i had a check engine light the interior ergonomics are in my opinion dreadful with the single cheap plastic cupholder as a start the plastic click click switches and more plastic parts that break sun visor clip center armrest for methe extremely annoying warnings theres the two hour stop driving and take a break warning the tone when you open the drivers door with the turn signal on it treats the driver like a moron never again
Audi,Engine/Performance,audi never again bought an a  with extended warranty made a maintanence checkup with keys audi in los angeles told me i had to wait  weeks i origanlly had a bad vibration problem to seek the appt anyway  weeks latwer at  mile son car they would not honor the  warranty and would not honor the extended warranty i called audi america and bitc made them honor the extended warranty only got an oil change and tire rotation screwed ok then i asked them what was the vibrationthey told memotor mounts wanted k from the dealer to fix i went to local mech for  replaced them vibration was still there  days later engine blew due to timing chain failcalled themdid nothing
Audi,Comfort/Interior,always something wrong with it i bought my a in may  it was one problem after another  the trunk compartment for holding the top broke and needed to be replaced  the final straw was when the transmission needed to be replaced with only k on the car  it had been making some strange creaking noises but the dealer kept insisting it was just loose bolts they needed to tighten  after several visits to the shop they finally determined that the transmission was defective  in  months of owning the car it was probably in the shop for a total of  weeks  i would never buy another audi  very poor quality
Audi,Comfort/Interior,"the a convertible the wide threshold results in difficulty getting out of the car  coupled with wide doors that dont open enough when in a parking space the car is just not comfortable unless youre over  feet or want to push the seat all the way back to get out  also when the top is up the visibility is very poor when backing out of a parking space"

Audi,Engine/Performance,worst car ever a week after i bought the car the fuel pump went center arm rest broke and so did the glove box closed the door one day and the side air bags went off  in repairs for the side airbags but was covered by audi usa thermostat broke twice the speakers cut in and out rear windows wont work and front ones work when they feel like it burns a quart of oil every  miles audi says this is normal had to replace the clutch and transmission rebuild coils always fail leading to misfiring witch overheated my engine blowing the head gasket and cracking the head there is lots more im forgetting i could have bought this car ten times over
Audi,Engine/Performance,nothing but problems purchased vehicle used with k mileage ultrasport t came with apr stage upgrade problems with air bag module dealer fixed under warr ignition coils went bad cost  fuel pump bad along with some type of sensor that regulates the fuel to the engine caused car to dump too much fuel and flood engine cost  defective coolant seal anti freeze was leaking in the rear of engine about  and of course the famous timing belt that bent the valves at k and defective passenger side window module cost  and thats with my own valve head i received free from a friend now the bank  o sensor is bad and its leaking oil like crazy dealer said defective oil cap
Audi,Engine/Performance,major let down bought this car used july th  immaculate condition no dents no scraps everything worked one month into it the auto leveling headlghts malfunctioned power windows failed pirelli tires were awful then coil packs failed engined missfired and had to be towed away rattles galore i love the engine sound interior style material quality and over all subtle style if youre gonna buy this car buy a good after market warranty and have it inspected thouroughly before purchasing
Audi,Service/Maintenance,poor a reliability and dealer support in less than  years and  miles we have spent  on repairs to our audi  for a door that distorted  for a clutch that failed  we also have a broken catch on a glove compartment unfixed so far despite the car having a  mile year warranty the dealership has steadfastly refused to fix anything under warranty  from what we can gather this policy seems to be driven by audi of america we will never buy an audi again
Audi,Engine/Performance," turbo w spd  the turbo lag is noticable but winding the engine up even just a little on take off takes care of this  the  speed also helps quicken the car up a great deal as compared to the automatic  we went with the sport package which does make the ride firm but mini vans and suvs really become annoying on on and off ramps"
Audi,Service/Maintenance," audi a  a lemon my audi a is on the brink of lemon classification  it has been in the shop for  days i bought the car just  months ago and sadly ive had problems with it for the past  months according to the service center it is not safe to drive it shakes violently and for some unfortunate reason always decides to buck when coming to a stop the transmission part needed is on back order  audi has no idea when it will arrive apparently tracking systems are not part of audis lexicon i highly advise anyone interested in purchasing this vehicle to do plenty of research on the cvt system and think twice before going down this path"
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,i wish i never bought this car i bought my a in november of  with k miles and now have k on it i live in new england and wanted a  wheel drive sedan in the three years i have owned the car ive replaced the windshield wiper motor twice  each and the windshield washer pump once  ive also had to replace the  the rack and pinion steering all  ignition cylinders timing belt and water pump audi recommendation   brakes  im at the point im afraid to drive the car on any long trips and use it as little as possible  ill be trading it in soon for a honda civic going to take a hit on the trade in value and what i owe but i just cant afford to keep the audi
Audi,Engine/Performance,lemonade on wheel first of all this is the worst car ive ever owned second of all the worst car i ever ownednow you got my point at k miles replaced the cvt transmission k cv boot x headlight every months it goes on never will ever buy or own an audi again worst than yugo and id rather drive a pacer
Audi,Service/Maintenance,"i hate my car this car is loud has no power and ithandles like a truck audi service ispoor i have received better servicefrom  general motors honda and toyotadealersdo yourself a favor and buy a clkfrom   mercedes"
Audi,Comfort/Interior,"poorly built car we have had our audi for less than a year and it is one problem after another  we the car arrived the convertible top was coming apart at the seams on the interior  it took a week to repair  then the compartment in the trunk used for storing the roof broke and it took  trips to repair it  last time it was in for service they found a small transmission fluid leak  two months later it is in again and now they have to replace the transmission  worst made car weve ever purchased"
Audi,Price/Value,couldnt be happier i owned saab what a difference
Audi,Price/Value,"door is solid  judge cars not by their price but their quality but for this car it kicks ass in both department"
Audi,Engine/Performance,"a sedan  my dad bought me this car  it has all the safety features luxury amenities and performance i expect from a german car"
Audi,Engine/Performance,audi a has a serious enginer problem engine coils failed one by one on my
Audi,Engine/Performance,oil guzzler unreliable heater fatal timing belt some things to look out for if youre looking for a used  audi a audis are known for guzzling oil and this car is no exception if you are buying a used car you may need to flush out the heater core it has a flaw where it will accumulate gunk over the years and the heat will not work until it is flushed also ask about how recently the timing belt has been replaced if yours snaps the interference engine is toast
Audi,Engine/Performance,engine dead at  i live in a city and rarely take road trips  after ten months of ownership and replacing all ignition coils i went for one  two hours into the trip felt slight vibration that stayed the same for the rest of the trip  an hour away from home on the return trip vibration started to worsen and became very bad right out of city limits  immediately to dealership where i was informed the crankshaft was warped  new engine from audi  with wait for it a  day warranty  local junkyard  for a used engine with two year warranty  in the end i traded it for a ford
Audi,Engine/Performance,money burner if you are getting a warranty than its a nice car but without a warranty you may be getting into something you can not afford in the long run  my car has the infamous sludge build up and my engine is now seized either pay  to replace it or get into an upside down loan for another  yearswith that being said minus the sludge and the bad engine i did have some good time in this car
Audi,Engine/Performance,beware the  audi a wd i purchased   audi as at the same time just as the warranty expired similar defects appeared in both cars  in just over two years almost everything has gone wrong with both cars they are both lemons the audi dealership we went to charged me almost k for  visits in which they couldnt diagnose the problem the turbo exploded  weeks ago in one of them and damaged the engine in the process both cars are a money pit and i am attempted to dump both  absorb the loss audi corporate apologized for my frustration  loss  asked if there was anything else they could do today dont buy these cars
Audi,Engine/Performance,lovehate hate this is truly a drivers car both interior and exterior finish had a classy sturdy feel economy and performance were great city and highway up to  long range trips now for the nightmare the list that went wrong was excessive items that normally should have no problems for  years miles started to fail within two week of ownership although the warrantydealer took care of everything while in warranty afterwards it got out of control  audi could care less other than to close my filed complaints as soon as possible  own it get rid of it after warranty shelf life is short
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,my beloved mechanical trainwreck i love this car  i also hate this car bought it with  miles on it and k later had to replace the clutch of course not under warranty  since then traction control cpu has failed dealership fails repeatedly to fix it three ignition coils have failed one on vacation the list goes on  i cringe when the car so much as shudders now it feels as though the things just waiting for the worst possible moment to break  styling is great fuel economy is decent interior comfort and design is stellar turbo lag is ridiculous the power delay is embarrassingly pronounced the mechanical issues are too much  this has soured my opinion of audi my next car will not be an audi
Audi,Engine/Performance,questionable reliability poor acceleration for a  v fuel economy is abysmal for the level of performance electrical problems and fuel pump failures continue to plague this vehicle remote transmitters quit after k miles once the warranty expires be prepared to sink thousands into the vehicle look elsewhere for an entry level luxury sedan
Audi,Design/Style,poor cvt reliability the problem is that the cvt transmission is a sealed closed design and cant be rebuilt or fixed a replacement transmission costs about  installed  not worth keeping out of warranty
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,disappointing audi my  a t quattro k miles is constantly in the shop  the dealership once forgot to change the oil during scheduled maintenance forcing a breakdown on   another time the oil pump failed again forcing a breakdown on   further separate fuel coils have failed forcing two additional breakdowns on the highway  aside from reliability the a t quattro is a sluggish car although it handles nicely in bad weather  i previously owned an a and had similar issues  while this car looks good inside and out its reliability is unsatisfactory to put it mildly  i will never buy an audi again and i urge you to exercise caution before purchasing one
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,not too bad ive had this car for over  years now had to get the windshield replaced in the first week it had a defect that made everything look wobbly the fuel pump gave out at  yearsk miles stranding me at  am very frustrating i have since witnessed about  other identical models stranded in parking lots or on the freeway since the fuel pump the car has not given me any problems aside from strange electrical issues such as the mirrors rotating out of memorized position
Audi,Price/Value,fun to drive but expensive to own my  a has  miles on it i bought the car for about  and have spent over  on repairs the car is poorly built and unreliable it is very difficult to work with audi of america and the local dealers are terrible before buying one of these cars i would strongly recommend talking to someone who has owned one and checking out the service of the dealers where you live and the estimated service costs my car has had several major problems in the   years that i have owned it and neither the dealer nor audi or america seems to care
Audi,Comfort/Interior,"fun to drive but awful service i spent a great deal of time researching bmws x mercedes c class and others in the end i chose audi my  audi  is a blast to drive the car handles well and goes like gangbusters the interior is well designed and very comfortable however in the past year and a half i have had the car in for repairs about a dozen times problems include keys that stopped working  times replacement ac compressor abs airbag and other dash lights showing drive train out of balance key fobs that would not lockunlock the doors etc whats worse ive had to take the car back to have dch either redo their work on multiple occasions what a let down"
Audi,Service/Maintenance,back to the dealer my wife has owned this vehicle for
Audi,Design/Style,disappointed this thing is a money pit  cant believe how much it costs to fix every little thing  have had the car almost  years now  i cant take it any more  if you happen to be looking at one of these things stay away
Audi,Engine/Performance,so long audi bought this car almost two years ago from an audi dealership sadly the engine has failed due to the infamous oil sludge buildup issue in the t engine car was always maintained at audi dealer the car is beautifulbut it will be moving on to greener pastures with someone who would like to put a new engine in it timing belt also had to be replaced ignition coils etc too many recalls for truth in engineering audi
Audi,Price/Value,will cost you a ton my a was great under warranty too bad that expired at  miles lately its cost about  a month just to keep it running and ive only got  miles on it oh and the dealership just told me i needed to replace the timing belt  when i took it in to get checked out for the class action suit against audi so needless to say i will never buy another audi agian or ever recommend anyone buy one
Audi,Engine/Performance,downhill after k after k miles my  audi a t now at k miles began to require very expensive repairs that i never needed for other vehicles i owned with over k miles i had to replace the phlange that connected the coolant system to the engine the steering rack and pinion the windshieldheadlight washing fluid pump and motor and the dealer says that i need to soon replace engine gaskets i do not know much about the mechanics of cars but from my experience it is unusual that such major repairs would be required on a vehicle that still has relatively low mileage and is owned by someone who is very diligent with all of the routine maintenance wish i had purchased the extended warranty
Audi,Engine/Performance,do not buy we bought this car thinking it was going to be reliable  after  years we had to replace the engine now at  miles we need a new transmission  it has been one thing after the other and i will never buy an audi ever again  nobs all wear or fall off interior tears head lights burn out every  seconds not only have i spent tons of money having to repair the car i want to get rid of it and it isnt worth anything horrible resale bad bad bad that is all i have to say
Audi,Price/Value,dont buy one this car has been in the shop more than i have had it at my house i am currently out of warranty and nobody wants to work on this car so im forced to pay through the nose at the dealer every headlamp side marker tail lamp has burned out twice sinced ive owned the vehicle  the vaccuum hoses have busted the ws wiper motor burned out the cd player quit working the computer went bad it eats tires like crazy and the list goes on and on besides that it is a great vehicle prior to this vehicle i owned an acura and traded it in at k miles and never had any issues except for replacing the tires  i will definitely go back to the acura line and would not recommend audi to anyone
Audi,Engine/Performance,worst car ive ever owned in my  years of driving ive owned corvairs and amc products that would be considered problem cars but nothing matches the unreliability of an audi i purchased both a  and  a and have become very familiar with the local wrecker companies the  is now having its th engine installed after only  miles the stereo system has been replaced three times we traded in the  at a loss after being towed three times for coil issues stay away from audi this is the worst car ive ever owned including the  corvair i paid  for in
Audi,Engine/Performance,"sad audi experience unfortunately our experience has not been a happy one audi is presently installing our third engine in our  a after only  miles our car has spent nearly  months in the shop in the past  months weve bought a new maxima and plan to sell our audi as soon as possible"
Audi,Comfort/Interior," audi a  what a fun car to drive with the manumatic shifter  the fun of a standard but also the ease and convenience of an automatic transmission  my only complaint about this car is the relatively small amount of storage  pockets in the doors and on back of the front seats but hardly any room for cds or sunglasses"
Audi,Service/Maintenance,this is not a chevy i bought a  t a just over a
Audi,Engine/Performance,bose stereo  not impressed the bose stereo is a weakness sound
Audi,Service/Maintenance,"horrible experience im the owner of a  a t quattrocar broke down  times within a year was stuck  miles from my home in  degree weather with my wife   year old motherinlaw who suffers from alzheimers for over  hours until roadside assistance pickedup car dealer would not approve rental car until they saw car being roadside asssitance took so long dealer was closed horrid experience feel very unsafe in car will never drive again  years left on lease"
Audi,Engine/Performance,"read the good and bad be objective so ive owned my a for about a year and a half and now im on edmunds shopping for a decent used one  i consider myself a demanding driver and as a performance vehicle its a great ride  but in the shop  times over the past year is insane  clutch suspension issues ignition coils  the worst was being a center console electronics flake out that left me using a loner for a week  considering aftermarket chip  risk screwing that powertrain warranty and youll have the sweetest looking lawn ornament in town  i wanted this thing to work cause its sweet looking package  but ive learned much more about cars than i cared to through this headache"

Audi,Mileage/Fuel,bad design high oil consumption hesitates on acceleration smokes valves leak faulty transmission control module and ac compressor issue
Audi,Engine/Performance,dont recommend audi the car dont last i have a  a and the engine is terrible  i have had it in service  times and its there again  they dont know how to fix it
Audi,Design/Style,jetta with the name audi on the grille i have an  jetta and im completely unhappy with it probably because i have owned volvos before i have had this car for about  days now and when i get into the car i feel like i am in the jetta the console is still small with the small cup holders underneath the ignition jingle never stops until both the driver and passenger have thier sealt belts on and just all the little things about the jetta are in a that would make you skeptical to pay  for it the turbo charger has a delay when u push on the accelerator i do have to say though that the seats are comfortable and the styling outside is excellent
Audi,Service/Maintenance,worst car ever please test drive this car extensively dealer will not tell you that the car goes forward when you put car in reverse they say this is normal for cvt transmission this was not disclosed before purchase i dont think they would ever sell any cars with cvt if this was disclosed do not buy this car
Audi,Engine/Performance,horrible car mechanically i just bought this car  months ago and it has  miles on itit is burning oil like you wouldnt believei took it in to the audi service department and they said the first step is to replace the crankcase pressure regulatory valve and put the audi software update on it which cost  for thatoverall the cost is if this doesnt fix the problem the engine pistons need to be replaced so basically a new engine for audi needs to recall the  liter engineswhy would you charge  for a car and the engine goes out at  miles obviously this is a faulty engine
Audi,Service/Maintenance,noisy brakes i love my new audi a  avant wagon but very concerned about the noise the brakes make it sounds like a loud creaking noise each time i apply the brakes regardless of whether the brakes are cold or warm there is an abnormal amount of brake dustas well the audi dealership tells me that this noise is normal and to help quiet the noise i should slam on the brakes in an empty parking lot to reset them i actually did this to no avail this seems silly and hard to accept for a new k car also the gps is extremely difficult to use  very complicated seats are not very comfortable after the first  hours other than these few issues the vehicle performs and drives very nicely
Audi,Engine/Performance,disappointed motor mounts gone bad at  miles
Audi,Price/Value,this car only problems bought this this car at k mileage in one month i drove the car only  days then the rest of the time the car was at the dealer for repairs burning quarter high expensive oil every  miles they said the turbo needed to be replace cost stay away from this car
Audi,Engine/Performance, audi a quattro i dont recommend this car to anyone when the car is running it is great but that isnt the case a lot of the time i bought used certified preowned at  miles and traded it in at  miles the car had everything go wrong from a blown up engine to a parasitic battery drain that killed my battery a lot was covered under the factor warranty but after  miles if anything goes wrong it is a bare minimum of a  repeat do not recommend
Audi,Engine/Performance,excessive oil consumption and many other problems do not buy this car at all  buyer beware we first leased and bought a  a car and it uses oil extensively  it did not even pass its first smog check and now the car is considered a total lossthe audi dealer  said that it will cost  to replace the whole engine we have tried many cars from the past from bmw mercedes and lexus and this is the worst car in our livesi just read the class action lawsuit on this car extensive oil usage  it is outrageous and we brought in the dealer twice and they did not warn usi hope audi this review and rectify their problem  this is unacceptable
Audi,Engine/Performance,way too many problems i love audis and have always wanted one for myself i purchased my first audi less than a year ago  a used  audi a it was fantastic for a few monthsand then the oil problems started less than a year in and i have spent over  fixing oil problems which are not covered under the recent lawsuit it really has made the car not worth it in the least additionally the first audi dealership i went to had the worst service i have ever experienced stay away from audi of westwood mass they literally broke my engine hood one of the times i had to leave my car there everything about them was terrible from misquoting repair costs to not getting the right repair done the first time they are horrible so yeah love the car but its unfortunately not worth it go for a benz or bmw i guess
Audi,Service/Maintenance,this car is horrible worst decision of my car buying life  it was the only  left on the lot and had every conceivable option  problems arose quickly   the steering feels like something is rubbing or a belt it loose  back to dealership  times before i was told that there was a service bulletin out on it and no fix yet  transmission lurches in the dynamic mode  after  visits was told that there was a service bulletin out on it and there was no fix yet filled out more than one survey on it and never received help  for an almost k car this is a disgrace  have written audi many times to just give me my money back  how do you think that is going  bad mistake
Audi,Price/Value,navigation packet and blue tooth i got the navigation packet with the car and i am very disappointed with it the navigation system is completely useless difficult to use and find places and lacks information about almost everything it serves only for ornamental purposes as it doesnt take anybody anywhere even worse the situation only two months after i got the car i got the offer of the navigation update and ridiculously i had to order and pay for it myself this issue was not addressed by fred baker the dealer neither by audi after several calls and emails i made to them the bluetooth does not connect to my phone either
Audi,Comfort/Interior,great car but uncomfortable  front seats both front seats proved to be uncomfortable during long driving periods the problem is that the seats side support bolsters are so high and firm firmer than all other luxury  cars of the same class  that they provide undue pressure on the hip bones  the outside side supporting plastic exacerbates the situation by not allowing any amount of downward give of the seat thus  when exiting the vehicle the plastic support and firm bolster provides undue pressure on legs
Audi,Comfort/Interior,worst car ever owned i am  miles into an audi a quattro and it is the worst car i have ever owned the driver seat is so uncomfortable i can only sit in the car for no more than  min all the dealer suggested is to get a pad the ride is awful  pebbles become large rocks rough roads rattle your teeth i am missing my old ford  more every day if you are considering this car be wary take a long test drive
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,love it i like almost everything about my new audi a  the one negative thing is that the rims get dirty every time i drive it even if its around the corner  someone mentioned that it might be the brakes
Audi,Engine/Performance,expensive repairs paid about  for the a  quattro  cylinder  engine seized about a year later cost  to replace with a used  mile engine  ac just packed it in at the tune of  to fix  drivers door window falls into door  leds on stereo are mostly burned out  very annoying buzz from rear wheels
Audi,Price/Value,should have sold it this review is cathartic because who cares about this car anymore  up until k it was okay as far as maintenance and repairs are concerned after that look out  its like a bad marriage you hope and deceive yourself into believing it will get betterand it doesnt  i could have bought another car with the amount of money spent on repairs  its not just the cost but the repeated occurrences the dealerships are horrible and audi usa is even worse i will never again own an audi unless its given to me because then the cost of repairs will be like i purchased it it shouldnt cost me the price of  cars to own one
Audi,Price/Value,ill never buy an audi again stay away i bought this car mainly because of the look  i still love the look  its too bad the rest of the car doesnt hold up   these cars are finicky  if you dont use synthetic oil you are asking for trouble  my car is dead after k miles due to oil sludge  which is sad for a car built in the s  i gave it regular k oil changes but i used normal oil  thats only part of the problem  this car was in the garage every  months for this that and the other  expensive suspension failures cat converters going out water pump cracked fluid reservoirs valve gasket leak etc etc etc  come on audi  have some pride
Audi,Design/Style,expensive bought for k over k spent on ball joints bad design tierod ends sway bar links steering rack and hose lots of money  suspension design is a joke with the exception of the struts never need to replace stupid stuff can break like my  steering rackhose installation good vehicle for a high roller who can afford to be robbed on parts and labor
Audi,Engine/Performance,poor quality car like our audi a the a is very unreliable after k miles in the last  months we have paid over k in repairs engine x ignition key they are fun to drive but with such an unreliable nature and highmaintenance cost they are not very attractive cars any longer
Audi,Price/Value,not impressed the worst  thousand ive ever spent
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,ouch talk about everything going wrong
Audi,Price/Value,"beware of timing belt nightmare i was so excited to purchase my audi now i cant wait to sell it asap i have had very expensive repairs extensive headaches and extraordinary poor customer service  i specifically asked if timing belt should be changed at  miles i was told no manual states  i was driving mph and my timing belt completely blew at  miles and i almost lost my life when the car stopped suddenly audi refuses to assist in any way or show concern even though the part was found to be essentially defective very expensive repair buyer beware i have been contacted about a pending class action lawsuit for this"
Audi,Engine/Performance,"this car is a major disappointment always trusted german engineering and reliability but this car is a complete disappointment regular maintenance and repairs would cost you an arm and a leg audi dealerships are not the best to deal with my cars engine cracked at k no hard driving and the dealership had no idea that it cracked but suggested a whole list of other repairs paid them for the useless repairs and at the end they simply told me that a new engine is what i needed"
Audi,Price/Value,worst car i have ever owned costly mainteance nightmare thus was
Audi,Engine/Performance,"tried german once  once puchased a certified used audi a   turbo to experience some german engineering  unfortunately engineering was the problem as the vehicle lost both a timing belt prematurely causing k in damage and then the transmission gave out as well for another k  the car had less than k miles at the time of both and the car was well maintained with one owner  after contacting audi none of the items were covered under the warranty because they were considered wear items so the charges were all out of pocket expenses  never again"
Audi,Engine/Performance,bad audi bad audi the first week the engine noise sound like a diesel engine battery dead after  yrs misc controls and knobs stop working when top down the driver window rattles i think i bought a lemon brought to the dealer they said the engine noise was normal they didnt do nothing with the window
Audi,Engine/Performance,do not trust sometimes locks doors when i exit car even w motor running which should be impossible once refused to shift down while passing a car and refused to accelerate in any selected gear except drive revs would peak at k even with accelerator planted firmly to firewall tried every possible position of gear selector and punched the accelerator to downshift during  miles of freeway driving to no avail after shutdown no problem do not trust this car dealers tech indicates he never heard of such a problem dealer is  miles distant and tech doubts problem can be diagnosed since no warning lights were lit
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,no lights finally had to trade the car due to headlights randomly shutting off also constant check enginelight always seemed to have some issue or problem
Audi,Comfort/Interior,money to blow if you have money to blow and you want a flashy luxurious thrilling sports car then you need an audi a quattro the car is a rock star however if you dont have a spare  to blow at all times this car is not for you even if you take obsessive care of it the car will have problems im quoting the audi service rep britney at audi chandler arizona my ac blew out  to fixshe said it happens all the time i constantly have to replace interior parts like the glove box cover dash case and shift knob compartmentrepairs routinely cost over  combine with  regular maintenence and you have a serious ethical decision to make is it worth it not for me honda
Audi,Engine/Performance,audis life lesson if i only listened to my friend who begged me not to purchase an audi after an awful experience my life would have been much better over the past three years twelve check engine lights later and a new transmissioni am here to proclaim that audi is a nightmare and does not stand by its product during a three year period my a was in the shop approximately  days audi is one of the few cars that charge a deductible for part covered under a cpo warranty i had to shell out  per visit which amounted to  not including tax if you dare to own an audi and like misery i suggest getting a warranty to ease the pain although my audi experience was painful i learned a life lesson
Audi,Engine/Performance,will never own an audi again i purchased this car as a certified preowned vehicle at miles thankful i purchased the warranty in the st week check engine light came on few weeks later my fuel pump went out a couple months later some valves have failed in the engine a couple months after thatsome hose have melted and caused a check engine light then coil pack then transmission transmisson again fuel pump again oil pump engine valves all in a  yrs  miles now im selling this car as soon as i get it back from dealer never again i only drive to and from work on the hwy scheduled maint always was done but it was a lemon no help from dealer or audi usacant admit there is an issue

Audi,Mileage/Fuel,audi a t  poor gas mileage the gas mileage is worse than a v ford f loaded ford truck  mpg hgwy audi a  mpg hgwy dont by the cvt you cannot accelerate smoothly from a stop it hesitates and then bam it lunges especially on a ramp in a parking structure or making a left turn nice you cannot use the center console because it interferes with the hand brake lovely the brakes chatter when slowing from  mph eg coming down an offramp from the freeway absolutely the worst car ive ever owned dont buy an audi
Audi,Comfort/Interior,overrated ive had my audi for months already had to get  headlight replaced it shifts horribly squeaky interior at high speeds i get rattles from the dash very annoying im glad its a lease no more audi for me only good thing is the looks and design build quality is awful i have every option to include titanium pkg seats are a bit uncomfortable back seat space is minimal no power for t oh and they dont use real leather seats
Audi,Service/Maintenance,here we go again i had a  tt  great car to drive but reliability was terrible  with only  miles everything went wrong  well i deceided to try audi again only one week old and the memory seats dont work hello audi they make a great driving car and thats it reliability is horrible  the current clutch is also a disaster  it has no definite grip point
Audi,Engine/Performance,never by an audi again this car was reliable for the first  years but since then it has been nothing but a money pit it has broken down at the side of the road several times and every time its at least a  dollar visit to the garage the interior quality is bad cup holder broke hatchback interior paneling broke the engine is underpowered like many awd cars it goes through tires quickly it is just not a well built car
Audi,Service/Maintenance,mistake this is a terrible car do not do it i sold my lincoln hoping the awd would help me out in the winter and i sold the car within  months of having it my clutch was bad the back axles were screechy  fix wiring for blinker was bad  fix the cd player didnt work right the tape player ate tapes the cigerrete lighter wouldnt openi couldnt charge my phone or gps one of the rear windows wouldnt roll up or down the display screen was broken the bumper began to fall off after  weeks the buttons were coming off on the key fob awful
Audi,Design/Style,wont change it for the world i bought her at  miles and so far in almost  years ive put about  miles on it just changed the timing belt a few months ago this is a good thing to do when you go over  miles of course ive had some problems with the abs module and control arms that seem to be the common issues with this car most of the repairs to the suspension brakes or rotors can be done by the home mechanic since the car is so well thought and with a set of wrenches you can do a lot also look for aftermarket parts since the ones from the dealer have some outrageous prices like somebody said you have to pay to play
Audi,Engine/Performance,worst purchase ever beware i wish i could go back to the day i bought this a and run it has been nothing but trouble since day one problem  ruined front suspension   problem  defective turbo valve   problem  defective catelytic converter   problem  defective wheel bearings  leaving them and so on and so forth basically this car is an overpriced and less reliable ford pinto i should have bought an escort  this thing was the biggest mistake ive ever made i will buy a bmw next time  consider yourself warned
Audi,Engine/Performance,audi aless cash in your pocket not to beat a dead horse this is the absolute worse car ever radiatorreplaced at k miles warranty abs twice out of pocket brakes out of pocket power window still doesnt work suspension major work at k vacuum hoses bad at k recall after recall etc etc etc  this car is a nightmare for maintenance the car stumped several mechanics several times they just didnt know how to fix it and these guys were very smart they just kept throwing parts at it until the engine light or whatever went offthe nightmare is over i just sold this stupid thing and bought lexus ill never ever go back to audi ever  what a racket make a car that fails every month and then rip off the consumer with high price parts who ever heard of  for a catalytic convertor  x for exhaust components alone
Audi,Engine/Performance,bad mechanical fun to drive if its not in the shop  have had new engine too  lots of mechanical problems
Audi,Price/Value,not as bad as some say i purchased my audi a with  miles and it now has  miles ive replaced brake pads water pump timing belt wtensioner t pulley idler pulley drive belt front diff axle seal wires and plugs and oil although this would have cost alot at a dealer i purchased the parts online and replaced them myself if your a decent mechanic or have alot of  id highly recomend this vehicle the  is a little under powered wtiptronic trans but nothing beats the quattro in the michigan winter
Audi,Engine/Performance,"get out your wallet this car is junk you would have to be insane to buy an audi ai drive mine  miles per year tops and havedone  worth of repairs with less than  miles on it  ive had bad wheel bearings timing belt which will destroy the engine if it ever breaks water pump radiator hoses mass airflow sensor and now the thermostat  the dealer charges  to replace the thermostat  a  part even in peak operating condition this car would get killed by a honda civic in a drag race and gets lousy gas mileage  do not be fooled by the audi badge these are volkswagens in disguide except the maintenance is twice as expensive  get a lexus"
Audi,Comfort/Interior,"a cute exciting lemon this car is lots of fun to drive and the front seats are reasonably comfortable  the rear seats are really only for children and small adults  unfortunately as soon as this car came out of warranty numerous problems cropped up  audi usa has been nothing short of terrible in terms of responding to our concerns  no more audis for us  i would suggest only purchasing this car with an extended warranty that includes coverage for gaskets and leaks"
Audi,Comfort/Interior,"huge disappointment wish id stuck with the bmw this car has been nothing but trouble from day  transmission replaced before k miles windshield cracked sitting in a garage air conditioning controls failed instrument cluster unit failed windshield washer pump transmission again squeaks  rattles that cant be fixed"
Audi,Engine/Performance,"not as good as they say most things with this vehicle are good but the bad things are very annoying tiptronic which shifts too soon and cant make up its mind what gear to be in brake pads which bind in their seats brake discs warping unfortunately it is a blast to drive"
Audi,Comfort/Interior,new a premium plus just traded in my  a the difference is dramatic bought with every possible upgrade if you like a hard drive german machine this is it i tested the a and thought i was in a lexus i got the black optics pkg with  wheels i love the hard feel plenty of power i put the car in dynamic mode and it reminds me of my  tr its a blast ok so its not as pretty as my a but it drives like a sports car the downside is all the electronics way to difficult to master but if pure driving is what your looking for you found it to update my listing mpg not what i had expected only getting about   very disappointed with the summer tire i just had to replace   car could use some more hp otherwise the car still runs and looks great debating moving away from audi when lease is up this is my  audi in a row possibly moving to lexus as the bmws are just too small
Audi,Price/Value,bought a new car not enough power to expensive t dealing with audi their staff is just an awful besides the fact that their ethics with the emissions issue speaks for itself it will be my last audivolkswagon car i buy
Audi,Price/Value,failed turbo before k miles the car has performed well but the repair costs are expensive and failures are occurring on a well kept vehicle under k miles the car had oil leaking issues which was solved and covered by audi a failed air condition unit at k miles and now at k miles a failed turbo which is very expensive
Audi,Mileage/Fuel, audi a have faulty rings and burn oil this is a known issue  just goggle audi a oil consumption problems and you will seeaudi has refused a recall and the fix  new rings and pistons  costs between   its really disappointing that audi has not stepped up to address this on a broader scale
Audi,Price/Value,audi lover cheated i have had nothing but expense after expense which is making it difficult to justify buying another audi despite my love for the cars  in nearly  years i have replaced the water pump rear bearings mass air sensor power steering rack which came from audi faulty and was warranty replaced by local mechanic turn signal headlight stalk tie rod ends sway bar links all control arms upper a and f r lowers the timing belt valve cover gaskets mirror directional button is bad and the car eats tires like the chocolate doughnuts i used to eat in my overweight youth i am questioning in anguish the merits of fine german enigineering
Audi,Price/Value," to own beware of maintenance costs bought the dealers demo and got the year warrenty at  k the problems started  front suspension    tie rod end and water pump     k  rear half shaft bearings   transmission valve body   and now the abs unit is shot and its back to the shop for another  that is  parts and service are very expensive i am selling and cutting my losses ill be buying a honda or toyota or an american car from now on what a piece of junk"
Audi,Engine/Performance,"will look swanky in  unlike the passat wagon avant styling is sublime its performance striking its in the details vw settled on aluminum roof racks a goes steel vw goes for a painfully boring interior audi goes tight  classic avant is designed with just enough room for hauling but it handles like a cool little sportscar drawbacks no backseat space a performance at low speeds is annoyingly sluggish it zips confidently on the highway but the neighborhood runs is a crawl from st to nd gear this for a v the red dash is cool but tough on the eyes"
Audi,Design/Style,love my german machine you cant go wrong with an audi
Audi,Mileage/Fuel,must have bought a lemon i bought this car used in  it was a owner vehicle with  miles  weeks after i drove it off the dealership it broke down thank goodness i decided to buy the extended warranty because it was  to fix all that went wrong in the year and a half i owned this car it was nothing but problems i would be anticipating it to break down every  months fuel line froze  times with heet in the gas tank tie rods needed replaced abs went out radio needed a code that nobody could find would not buy an audi unless i was making big bucks expect to pay a lot for maintenance
Audi,Engine/Performance,"disappointed bought this car new loved the looks and how it performed in the snow  however i spent way too much time at the dealer replaced  airbags starter wheel bearingstie rods and had repeated check engine problems  all the exterior molding fell off and interior was poor quality brake handle brokeas well as other interior parts  spent  for the car and it was not close to being worth it  did not hold its value and was not impressed with audi customer service bought a new subaru legacy and love it"
Audi,Price/Value,"own two as i have two of these cars  a  turbo fwd and a  turbo quattro  most of the people on this site who have rated these cars are idiots  comparing apples to oranges  yes if you have quattro it is goin to be sluggish in first and second  awd robs power you fools  dont compare it to a fwd japanese car  yes your car is going to need new tires and timing belt at  miles  stuff wears out suck it up  no it is not more expensive to fix than a japanese car  i have found it to be cheaper"

Audi,Engine/Performance,small package large performance sold it and got a bmw
Lexus,Engine/Performance,not impressed bought new in  hated it so traded my mom for her audi shes got k on it now and likes it the car doesnt have the driverroad connection like my audi or saab and doesnt feel expensive like other lexus cars around town speed is good but above  mph has no power original suspension had soso handling  comfort suspension was replaced x by dealer bc it kept squeaking now has kn suspension  handles  rides better other then that no problems not even brakes interior materials  design are cheap mpg is pathetic auto trans is overeager to upshift into nd gear which dulls acceleration unless you stay heavy on the throttle which eats more gas manual mode is worthless
Lexus,Price/Value,"dont do it i like driving this car  that being said    tires  the car comes wperformance tires which means they are soft  i had to replace them at  miles there is only one replacement tire right now  it cost over  for  tires   reliability  a few weeks ago the car died in as i was accelerating in an intersection  it was towed to lexus who tried to fix it for  days to no avail  on the rd day the car miraculously started  no explanation whatsoever  lexus customer service was not helpful and pitiful  i am thoroughly disappointed with this car"
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,lexus is m  have owned  months and thoroughly
Lexus,Engine/Performance,upgrade to performance i just bought a  lexus is
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,little devil pleasantly surprised how this car
Lexus,Design/Style,lexus is  sport design if i lived in my is  would people
Lexus,Design/Style,rollin in style i would recomend this vehical to any
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"go gita the sportcross is a small wagon with a supra engine  it moves like a cat and stops on a dime  add a turbo and run with m bmws but for thousands less the car has an aggressive naughty stance interior is sporty not luxurious  with the seats down i have loaded five kitchen cabinets with room to spare the rear floor lowers for added flexibility there are several stealth storage areas and hooks for tiedown straps called the altezza gita in japan accessories such as a roof rack are available via importers the sportcross is both practical and fun  if you want soft luxury get a different lexus if you want to ride a unicorn while everyone else is on a horse get a sportcross"
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,"never do again this car proves lexus cut corners i have been in service  times for simple stuff that continues to go wrong no power i should have bought a g and now to trade i will loose  in  months timevery unhappy"
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,fun  drive poor technology only  miles in but the navigation and lexus enform is terribly unreliable i wasted money upgrading to this option seat cooling and heating has a mind of its own
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,"cant go wrong with a lexus i purchased my is used with k miles about  months ago and so far ive havent had any problems with it  i used to drive a honda prelude with massive modifications so the is cannot compare to that car  off the line the is is slooooow but the v will catch up to any other car  i really wish it had a center arm rest that would help alot  also bigger cup holders  forget about getting big gulps from   i considered a bmw  series but read awful ratings about it  im glad i chose the is over the series  fin"
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"winterwet driving being rear drive and very light this is the worst car i have ever had for snowwet road driving even with the standard  tires the car would not move away from the curb in the first snowfall i put blizzaks on it and it is somewhat better but this vehicle is not recommended  for northern climates the tracs system also sucks it makes starting out on wet pavement chunky it also seems to have a hesitation on acceleration at times"
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,"very nice car but crappy service cons interior materials are poor quality my steering wheel leather started cracking after a couple months the oem tires were terrible and blew up on me one blew up after a couple thousand miles another one blew up later on the tire recall didnt help either since they killed the new tires which i bought to replace my old tires my center console plastic started fading pros very solid car great handling bottom line dont expect to be reimbursed for any parts that are built below standard be prepared to shell out quite a bit of money to fix little things like interior parts paint chips tires and so on"
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,"still turning heads  months miles no rattles or squeaks  only problem drivers side door pin popped out a couple of timesthe dealer replaced the hinge  no more trouble the back seat is cramped but since i rarely have passengers it isnt an issue for me i was looking for reliability and driving funwithin my budget  i found it  even though the new car smell is gone i am still taking the long way wherever i go  i just hate to stop driving it  it is a thirsty little beast but its hard to muster up any concern about it the mileage for stop and go driving has been  miles a gallon nothing prettier than my freshwashed blue isshe still turns heads"
Lexus,Engine/Performance,bought it used but it still had zero problems bought it w  kms and as a rebuilt title amazingly fun car to drive in the summer and is extremely reliable in  years owning it outside of having to change the brake pad and battery i only had to come in to the shop for oil changes and tire changes however the car is not good for heavy winter driving because its rwd and fairly light you have to be extremely careful when driving it in heavy snow roads as it tends to slide the stock stereo is unbelievable i tried a  bmw this year and the stereo on that didnt even match the  lexus is stereo also this cars safety features protected me very well when i was  tboned by another car i would highly recommend this car
Lexus,Engine/Performance,a different breed of lexus i buy cars for their performance and moddability and this car is very moddable having the supras jz and all but ill rate this car from a consumers point of view since you are probably interested in buying this car this is not your average type of lexus lexus are usually known for their comfort and amenities but this car is different the is  was designed to compete with the  series and that it does this is a sport sedan so it drives like one do not buy this car expecting the usual laid back handling of the other cars in the lexus fleet this is definitely the car to buy if you are looking for a reliable car that will add some excitement to your daily commute to work
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,little lexus with loads of attitude the car is smoothno problems so far
Lexus,Engine/Performance,my review grows on you after you drive it
Lexus,Engine/Performance,is  is a solid car i have owned the is  for only a week
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,"whats next i drive alot k per mo heavy la traffice or flat out on a freeway car handles both very well  got k on the clock new yokohamas to replace the crap potenza tires that are over rated at k in summary the biggest beef i have is the ability to adjust the drivers seat to my needs nada  beef  as the trans shifts in to nd under kickdown  acceleration goes flat  paint finish is not to the standard of the other lexus cars ie lots of rock damage paint readily nicks down to the metal suggest new buyers put a small bra on the nose when they first get it"
Lexus,Engine/Performance,i wanted so bad to like this car where do i startÂ… i have had this car at the lexus shop x in the past year for numerous rattles  squeaks which still arent fixed  i have had the clutch on the ac replaced the acheater fan motor replaced the heatingac control unit replaced  the sunroof track system replaced  i wanted so bad to like this car but it has been nothing but a pain  performance wise it just ok  the speed manual shifts hard  the traction control is bad kicks in when taking off or cornering hard  then stays activated too long causing lack of power  the car handles well on dry  wet pavement however its downright scary on any remotely slippery roads  i wished id bought a bmw again
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,whos supposed to buy these things the is  seems conceptually confused its an imitation series bmw but lexus had to muffle its road feel and give it unreadable instruments the instrument cluster on this car is the ugliest and least functional i have ever seen the traction control cuts the power on city street corners it burns much more premium gas than a car its size should it beeps if i get out of the car wrong  i guess if i wanted a toyota i should have gotten a corolla
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,wheel noise  it makes a lot of road noise and even
Lexus,Engine/Performance,hot driving car disappointment to geeks no doubt this car gets up and goes almost justifies the dismal sub mpg performance although in todays cars theres little excuse for such horrible mileage the dealership lied saying it wasnt premium gas i hate anything to get the sale salesmen and thats seattle lexus spot on even complaining to their manager gets you no return phone call no cussing or disrespect if you were thinking that as promised  the voice recognition is beyond a joke and yes i did the voice training no difference  why cant i buy up to the autobraking system when its in the software seriously no v to make up for your seriously underpowered usb that face up to let things fall into them bluetooth that works then doesnt  who designed this thing the seats are like rocks  pretty powerful but not tech friendly  you can get a lot more tech centric cars for a lot less and maybe a decent mpg
Lexus,Price/Value,dont buy if you have about k to spend in parts this car is perfect for you if you dont have that dont get this car parts are expensive very hard car to work on but maybe you get lucky i had alot of bad luck with mine also dont try to drive when roads are bad outside
Lexus,Engine/Performance,second is this is my second is i have owned  cars in my life i am  and get bored easily i have owned  bmws and thought myself to be a lifelong bmw addict the is changed all that the styling the responsiveness and dependability won me over i have never had an issue with either is i have owned they are the only cars i have kept longer than three months my current one i am tastefully modifying owning a gs in between the iss i am now a lexus jz convert all around service all my havetohaves sportiness luxury speed and dependable the is is truly the complete package
Lexus,Design/Style,hats off to lexus im closing in on  troublefree miles  every mile has been a delight  wish i could give a vehicle score of  for the reliability and funtodrive categories
Lexus,Engine/Performance,fun reliable car expensive to maintain its a quick fun car to drive on dry surface  worst car on the road in snow with high performance tires installed  running into high maintenance cost down the road  i have a  is  be prepared to drop  at the dealership on the timing belt at k and  when the oxygen sensor goes  rims and tires are a nightmare
Lexus,Design/Style,fits like a glove this car hugs the road and fits your
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,not an suv i have had this car for  months it
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,"should have kept my audi if all cars drove as poorly as mine wed all take public transportation the dealership when they can be bothered to return my calls tells me its normal for a lexus to have an extreme amount of vibration in the steeringwheel even on the smoothest roads you can find in southern california"
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,"sportcross i am  tall though lean so keep this in mind when i make my commentsfirst the car is not a bmw does not have anywhere near the handling typical sloppy plowing turning characteristics crummy perrelli sp tires poor mileage quality issues too"
Lexus,Design/Style,"my is  disappointingthe looks of the car grew real tired in a matter of months shouldve gotten the xterra"
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,buying another hybrid seating tight for a six foot plus driver
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,why do the rotors need turning after  miles fourth lexus and second hybrid  at first it was a dream to drive  very comfortable and solid on the road plenty of responsiveness in corners and in braking  as it is mostly driven by a little old lady on sundays i assumed it would be as reliable as the last couple  i was wrong  on the first scheduled maintenance visit we noted the the ac no longer blew cold and the brakes felt a little mushy  after two days at the dealership we were informed that rodents had chewed several wires causing the ac to no longer work the radio to act funny and other sundry issues that showed up during a thorough inspection  also asphalt had caked the underside of the car causing the rotors to need to be turned  they suggested that we contact our insurance agency to get all this fixed  i think this is ridiculous as the previous cars never had a problem with asphalt caking or ac losing freon or the radio stations not wanting to change after several minutes of scanning  i am very unhappy with this and am looking into other cars
Lexus,Design/Style,lexus es h driveing expirience is awsome but navigation sucks that joystic is dark ages poorly design and you cant operate most of the van while drivingi wont buy lexus again
Lexus,Engine/Performance,hybrid review the engine is extremely quite while idling or at slower speeds
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,most uncomfortable lexus i have ever owned ive owned a lexus for  years and and always loved themso i was hoping for a similar experience when i bought the  lexus es h premium packagethe car drives fine although there is that hesitation every time you start up after stopping which is common with many hybridsafter three years of ownership i am still only getting only  mpg and always have  i dont drive fast and i drive the way they say to in the manual to maximize mileage  the boxy styling is ugly  the interior materials are much lower quality than past lexuses i have ownedbut the worst problem is the ventilated seatit is very uncomfortableit is so bad that my back hurts every time i drive iti complained and the service manager acknowledged some people feel just like me and offered to put extra cushioning in the back although that would void the ventilation i said ok and although better it is still a terrible seat which makes me hate this car more and more every dayi went to trade it in and the value today is  less than what i paid for it three years ago  perhaps typical
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,first  miles  very poor mpg very poor mpg not even close barely  mpg  highway cityspeed was maintained withing limits  mh driving eco mode  even i hate iti feel cheated
Lexus,, h na
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,front driver seat is bad the front drivers seat hurts my leg and is uncondortable
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,lexus surprises me again i took delivery of this car recently for my wife this is the third lexus i have owned in the last  years the car has attributes that arent discussed in reviews example it emits an purposeful sound when driving slowly in ev mode to alert pedestrians to your presence the stereo without the mark levinson upgrade is impressive especially with a whisper quiet interior as to noise levels lexus has not insulated us from outside sounds but dialed them down somehow i like the ratcheted head rests but the front drivers seat is the worst on trips i have ever had i see no need for a gear shift yet one is there interior lighting is dynamic in that evidently it changes depending on what you are doing i traded the car in early the only time in my life i have done so because the front seats were miserable for my average build i have never gotten such a terrible back ache from a drivers seat like this before i do not know if it is because it is a hybrid that they reduced support in seats to save weight or not good news is when i traded it in it got top dollar
Lexus,Engine/Performance,wife loves it but i think its over rated first want to thank all the reviewsmy wife has waited for the updatedesh for a while nowoverall a good car but i dont think the value is therehopefully with the yen dropping so much lately the future buyer will reap the benefitwe wanted base model but went with premium pkgvery difficult to get with with base modelon quick notewe have  major dealers in atlanta areathe dealers were very cockynot very customer focus
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,brakes are terrible the brakes squeal on a consistent basis the dealership tells me that it is normal  i read the lc blogs and it is a common problem  lexus needs to address this issue asap
Lexus,Design/Style,not bad not great so close to being perfect a shame they blew a few details that make it less than so  the luxurysporty balance is second to none  ml stereo sounds wonderful although xm sounds crappy not lexuss fault  its xms signal compression  the nav is awful  it suffers from obvious languagerequirement translation issues in the design cycle  such a shame  stupid limitations and just not user friendly  nothing about it is intuitive  speech recognition is worst inclass  inability to recognize simple commands render it unusable  bluetooth only autoconnects with one phone  how dumb is that  very limited steering wheel controls mean constantly trying to navigate menus
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,this car has too many rattles im shocked at the amount of rattles this car has in the first few thousands miles as of today  squeaks and rattles ive been to the dealer  times with poor results i was informed that they were noise issues not rattles and to deal with them as the nature of the car  not the lexus service they advertise do not buy this car if squeaks and rattles bother you
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,beware squeaks and rattles my is  has been in shop  times  days for  squeaks and rattles in the  months of ownership ive never owned a car with so many issues regarding  squeaks and rattles i very disappointed with my is at this time  what happen to the lexus quality from  years ago  my last lexus never had such issues as this car does
Lexus,Price/Value,motor noise  i purchased a lexus is  about  months ago in the beginning i really loved this car and thought i couldnt live without it  now i know i can live without it when the weather is warm this car has very little motor noise but whenever the weather is cold the motor makes a terrible knocking noise when you crank the car  this is rather embarassing to know you pay k for a car that sounds like this and anyone standing by looks and says something is wrong with your car you should have it checked out i have had it checked out and lexus is aware of the problem but cant fix it so in the mean time they expect me to keep driving it hope you have better luck with lexus than i have
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,lexus is  very disappointed with the bluetooth system  poor design when compared to the competition disappointed with the nav that it basically shuts down after  mph  you have to go through some dippy override to get it to be functional  the homelink design is very poor  why on earth is it on the mirror  its not even illuminated cant find it in the dark  neither are the memory seat   lexus provides no information regarding the voice commands you have to search the internet to find out what they are  why  interior lights should come on as soon as the unlock button is pushed they dont until the door is opened and they are very dim
Lexus,Comfort/Interior, is   good bad and the ugly the good great throttle response power and comfort styling is much sportier than pictures appear  automatic transmission upshifts and downshifts almost perfectly  luxury feel very comfortable  the bad no manual option premium gas required numb steering  not much really   the ugly sportshifter and paddles are next to useless since you cant lock down the autoshifting to particular gear range only lock out a range until you upshift into it  trac off only stays off until you exceed  mph then its back on again
Lexus,Engine/Performance,not quite there i bought the is  because i thought the seq shifter would be cool i was wrong it got annoying after  weeks the shifting feels sluggish due to that the underlying tranny is still an automatic it may look fast but underneath the bodykits is only a  hp engine the crappy tranny ruins the  ponies in the luxury dept it also lacks the ride is sacrificed for the handling so if you are looking for a plush ride look elsewhere the plastic on the instrument panel feels like handmedown toyota parts
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,it sits too low i love everything about this car except how low it sits front end is below the average curb level mind did not come with parking sensors and i cant find them anywhere aftermarket this car should come stock with parking sensors  disappointed
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,check features before you buy this is the th lexus car i bought  when purchasing the nx i assumed certain features which i considered to be basic for a lexus car would be included  that is not the case  for instance i was considering an nx  but it did not have drivers seat memory  i had to buy an nx  h which the salesman said was topoftheline for over  msrp to get drivers seat memory and the parking sensors  however after i got it i realized this car does not turn on the wipers automatically when it rains a feature i already had in a  rx   the car also does not have the headsup display a feature i already had in a  rx h  in summary for the nx lexus is delivering a basic car which does not have the features you usually expect to get in a lexus car  so check what you are going to get before buying an nx
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,squeak i like the car but am disappointed with my drivers seat  every time i accelerate or slow down the seat lets me know it by emanating a loud annoying squeak  it sounds like there is a spring broken in there or when pieces of styrofoam are rubbed together  i have taken it to the dealer  times and they even replaced the seat once but they cannot fix the problem  it is so loud that even blasting the excellent radio does not help  i spend a lot of time in my car and this problem makes me want to trade the car
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,poor decision ive purchased lower end japanese built sedans in the past  i thought this was an upgrade  i couldnt have been more wrong  the transmission hesitates and it is normal i was told possibly because of this it has fair acceleration off the line it has the most uncomfortable drivers seat ive ever sat on its very hard i have not experienced near the same discomfort with other cars ive driven including rental cars from low small to large ones this purchase has taught me a lesson that a higher end brand does not come close to guarantee driving enjoyment it has been the exact opposite
Lexus,Engine/Performance,rides like a lexus when i purchased this car in  i was looking at mercedes benz e class  buying the lexus i stepped up in build quality comfort reliability and performance plus i kept  in my pocket  you cant beat lexus for those qualities and after three mbenzs i was tired of mechanical problems after  miles
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,car smells like rotten eggs car is beautiful inside and out  however at  miles it started smelling like rotten eggs  lexus says just a product of gas in oregon however not all es s smell which is a mystery says the dealership  lexus customer service just says tough luck  very frustrated  dealership hands are tied by lexus who says they cannot change any parts to try to correct problem if vehicle is running to specs
Lexus,Engine/Performance,bad and dangerous transmission this cars transmission hesitates very
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,"beware of this car the es has a plush ride is very quiet and has a nice looking interior however the transmission shifts very roughly also many exhibit a hesitation that makes the car feel like an old car with a dirty carburetor that bogs down when trying to accelerate it does not happen to every car but tends to get worse with time if your car is one of the unlucky ones the service people at two dealerships admitted to the problem but said there is no fix and that this has been a issue since the  models they believe it may be a computer software problem lexus does not admit they have a problem and offer no fix ultimately i got rid of my es after  months stay away from lexus"
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,"fix the transmission and dead pedal we bought this car in march   as far as the fit and finish the car is very nice the ride is ok with the junk bridgestone tires but that can be changed  the acceleration of this car is terrible and our previous toyota solara with a smaller motor would run away from this lexus  it has a very bad case of dead pedal and the transmission flat out sucks  with  miles on the clock already i dont think that the gas mileage is going to get any better either  i didnt know about the problems until tonight when my wife pointed them out to me but i will be at the lexus dealer this week and as far as i am concerned they will make it run right or they can keep the junk until they do"
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,lemon persistant pull to the left despite
Lexus,Engine/Performance,transmission needs fixing i had this car for  months and regret
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,"bad transmissions this cars computer has problems controlling the transmission  car hesitates badly at low speedgear  lexus knows but wont acknowledge because they cant fix it  ive sent  letters to hq and they tell me the car is operating as designed without even talking to the mechanics or my dealershi hmmm  city gas mileage is bad also about   read all the complaints about the trans on this site then buy something else"

Lexus,Service/Maintenance,our nd lexus we purchased an rx in december
Lexus,Engine/Performance,es  bad transmission my es  has a transmission that has
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,transmission problems bad fuel economy here we go  my  lexus es  is a piece of crap the car only have  mikes on it  for a lexus thats low here  are the problems bad transmission it is horriblevery bad fuel economy to be  correct i am seating on it as  we speak let me look  at  the avg it says    mpg  yes you hear that  mpg  my dad  has  hummer h the average on a hummer h avgis  mpg not too far off from from my lexus es   bad mpg and bad transmission those are my  major issues so if you like to be at the fuel pump every  days yes buy this car if you have extra money for transmission  yes go buy it  buy  of them
Lexus,Price/Value,lexus owner for life  simply put the car was built to last i now have  miles and counting m any of my passengers cant believe that my es  is  yrs old they say it rides like a new car i have owned  bimmers they are very well built and reliable cars but the cost of repairs is just crazy i will only buy lexus vehicles from now on
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,dont buy a  model i have the same issues as others with the transmission and it drives me crazy  i complained at the  mile checkup and the dealership told me we know about this common complaint but you will get used to it  in other words too bad  my car has  miles and i have not gotten used to it  so i will never buy another lexus because of it  this is my second one also the cup holder is so flimsy that it broke and they want  to fix it  the quality is equivalent to what you would find in a  car
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,ill buy another everything i had hoped for although routine maintenance is a bit pricey the resale value alone makes up the difference
Lexus,Engine/Performance,my  es  a very boring driving vehicle  transmission hesitates a lot  the tranny cant always get the right gear selected
Lexus,Design/Style,lexus no more i purchased a  esnew had it in for service  times  the transmission always felt like it was missing when slowing down and then accelerating  once you got going it is a very smooth ride  apparently the design is flawed there is a computer chip that needs to refresh which is fine if you never yield or slow down to go around a corner the dealership offered a new es with extra cost but i just purchased a  i bmw
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,size vs me the lexus es  is a nice car however its a bit cramped inside the between the seats cup holder is terrible and the acceleration is weak fuel mileage on trips is good but poor around town
Lexus,Engine/Performance,frustrated by lexus ive been wholeheartedly disappointed with the ownership experience  dealer acknowledges my problems but states lexus has no technical fix  problems are transmission surging when accelerating from a near stop say  mph following speed humps or in stopstart traffic  caused by computer controlled throttle and wind noise from drivers mirror  also dash  door rattles that come and go depending upon outside temperature  from a brand ranked by many as being of high customer satisfactory rating i personally have been wholeheartedly disappointed with the ownership experience  i truly want to love this care but remain frustrated with lexus and toyota  expected more for the money
Lexus,Engine/Performance,hesitation i bought my lexus this summer and have not been happy with it  the hesitation and jerking when starting to accelerate is not right  the dealer says this is normal for a v engine if thats the case im selling the drink holder between the front seats is in a bad location  if you try to use it and change gears you will spill the drink i have been very disappointed with lexus
Lexus,Engine/Performance,not perfect but close i was looking for comfort not performance and got exactly what i was seeking the car is exceptionally smooth and quiet  i was a bit disappointed that bluetooth and satelite radio are not standard  i bet this will change in the next year or two  i wanted the nav system because im a gadget junkie but i really do use it and it works well  i have the ventillated seats and the heating part works well but the ventillated part doesnt have a very strong blower so it is hard to notice the impact  the transmission shifting is a fairly serious issue particularly if you do a lot of stop and go driving  for cruising on the highway this is a hard car to beat
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,meets expectations  generally the es has been a very high quality and reliable automobile requiring very few repairs above and beyond the required scheduled maintenance  this vehicle gets decent gas mileage and generally averages about  mpg and also has a very quiet and comfortable ride  however i would be remiss if i didnt mention that this specific model has a slight hesitation in acceleration that the dealership was unable to correct  the automobile also has a fairly fragile paint job that scratches easily and is susceptible to rock chips  reading the center console displays of radiocd and heatingac settings can be difficult when wearing polarized sunglasses
Lexus,Engine/Performance,i rattle and hesitate i am your car  the problems lexus will not address
Lexus,Engine/Performance,overrated transmisson shift from reverse to drive
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,need to go back to manufactor  problem with transmission program
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"the es needs work the  ess have a serious problem with the throttletranny computer  ive read reviews saying the es does not correct that problem  lexus has acknowledged that customers have reported problems with the drivebywire system im one of those with major problems  im not sure how they could make a car that does not go when you give it gas but there are different driving situations where that happens  most notable is when pulling into traffic out of a parking lot  if not starting from a dead stop the computer causes a serious lag and does not kick the engine in for a second or two  ill never buy a lexus again if lexus does not fix this"

Lexus,Comfort/Interior,lexus for life i have owned a honda since remember
Lexus,Engine/Performance,lexi just purchased this car with  miles and short of the clunky struts and wind noise above  it is like driving a marshmellow dream decent acceleration if you can wait for it marginal handling on corners but dreamy smooth almost everywhere else did i mention how awful the cupholders are  talking awful  if i can figure out how to install an audio input i will like it even more
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,lexus from columbus in only three years the emission sensor
Lexus,Price/Value,"transmission and brakes my brakes had to be replaced at around  miles due to warped rotors  this also meant replacing the tires  fortunately lexus covered the cost  i just had them replaced again at  miles at my cost  was told that the area i live in is to blame since it is slightly mountainous  my husband has  miles on an  yukon and has never had brake problems  i also would have like a smoother shift in the transmission  they did the computer changeover but it is no better when i took it in last i was told the brake replacement at k was a recall  when i called lexus i was told there had never been a recall on the  lexus"
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,"ill never buy another one i had a  buick park ave ultra that was supercharged so i figured the hesitation and lack of power was because i was used to a different car the braking is poor brakes replaced at  milescar hesitates on accelerationdealer did the computer fix yesterdaystill the samehad loaner car  es same problemsbrakes acceleration etc"
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,"i liked my  lexus better this is my nd es i traded in a  model for this car power and gas milaege are less than last vehicle brakes on car were poor and unsafe when dealer serviced car he informed us there was a defect vehicle was not recalled brakes were dangerous customers are not notified you find out when you complain about the brakes i will never buy another lexus"
Lexus,Design/Style," the transmission on this thing is apiece of junk  i cant believe thatlexus would put out something so poorlytested  its so sad because i likeeverything else about the car  it hasmany great features but the reliabilityof the transmission is terrible evendangerous  lexus has promised over andover again that they will fix it but somany promises have turned into so many lies"
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"disappointed too many problems for a luxury car computer failure on braking system jerky transmission and inferior tires had to replace toyo tires at  miles due to very loud road noise the cost of replacement was partially covered by warranty poor radio reception without external antenna poor gas mileage for a car with no get up  go performance"
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"everything good but transmission i love everything except the slowrespond notsmooth transmission  this is not what i expect from a lexus  sometimes its getting so annoying that i hate my car  other than that everything else is soooooooo nice"
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"disappointment i have bought seven gm cars so far and would like to try something different so i went to the lexus dealership and drove the es the car looks great in the showroom interior material is something that gm cant even match build quality is good but gaps between body panels are wider than those on the acura the driving experience was disappointing the steeling wheel rattles when the engine is cold and the screen of the navigation system is rubbing against the frame and sqeeking noise can be heard when the road is badi cant believe this happened on a lexus becuase a new gm vehicle say less than a month old on michigan roads wont do that"
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,overall good car purchased this car in  it had  mi on it now the odometer shows  no major problems except with the radio system the lcd screen is unreadable it is very annoying the dealer wont admit that this is a recall  also had to replace a gasket seal due to a leak regular oil change and the car is fine
Lexus,Engine/Performance,dull car the cars electrical a continual problem  lexus dealership and other mechanics cannot extinguish vsc check engine and flashing seat belt lights  drivers seating for shorter person at six feet dtall my legs are cramped hit head at times when entering drivers side  semiquiet seats are comfortable  styling is cookie cutter blah  does not feel like an upscale car  would not buy another one
Lexus,Engine/Performance,reliability rating disappointing reliability i had to replace the transmission failed solenoid pump at k mi  you have the option of rebuilding or replacing lexus wanted  for this i rebuilt it for a hefty   the new  tranny is twice as expensive to fix as a  camry due computer chips in the transmission all  struts needed replacing at k mi as well  the check engine light has proven quite annoying as it appears a few timesyr due to a fuel system anomaly  this automatically disables the traction control system and a dummy light appears for it as well   mpg as i would guess this is standard for a  ltr v poor turn radius  disappointing reliability overall
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,lexus es   uae poor front and rear struts wind noise in average to high speeds doors and boot lid feels and sounds very flimsy
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,antoines review my experience with this car has been
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"im disappointed i had reservations regarding this es for me  not enough performance and nose heavy changed to  pilots which helped the nose heavy ride now at k the transmission needed to be  replaced  bad enough at k lexus of austin installed a rebuilt under the k warranty guess how i feel now  looking a at maxima gle or accura rl should have bought the  bmw in the first place"
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,broke car has been in the repair shop three times in less than  years  brake problems  what a pain for a  car
Lexus,Price/Value,a disappointing update now that i have had this car for   years i thought i would add an updated review  this is our th lexus and i am disappointed in the overall quality of the car  aside from the recall i have had a number of mostly minor quality related issues since my last review including an issue with paint chips on the front of the car and a blown out speaker in my expensive levinson stereo  if i had to do it over again knowing what i know now i would not purchase this car  i expected uncompromising quality in a car i could drive for  years like my last  less expense lexus vehicles  now i worry about expensive repairs down the road  i am thinking seriously about getting rid of the car
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,great car i waited until my  mile service to evaluate  this car makes me feel like im sitting in the lap of luxury wind noise issues are being taken care of with new side window glass later this week  biggest negative is that the navigation system features are rendered virtually useless while driving  it is silly to have to stop the car in order to find a nearby restaurant choice or gas station  this should be allowed
Lexus,Engine/Performance,gas mileage while im a little confused looking at the epa estimated milespergallon performance i certainly do enjoy the performance of my ls  around town including a mile interstate trip once a week im enjoying  mpg  on a highway trip when traffic is moving i can almost achieve  mpg and thats at  mph  except for a trunk opener failure this is an unbelievable machine
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,less car than earlier model took this car on two long trips to washington dc and florida and now have  miles on it  at highway speeds there is significant wind noise  also unlike my earlier  model ls  it feels lighter on the road  i dont feel any pride of ownership  yes it gets good gas mileage  miles on the highway  but no feel for the road and wind noise is simply awful  i miss my bmw
Lexus,Engine/Performance,luxury without quality after reading about the quality issues of the bmw  and mercedes sedans i bought the lexus   lexus  developed engine trouble after the first  miles or so  the car started shaking badly even at idle after phoning the dealer we limped home  tonight the dealer picked up the car with a flatbed truck and took it away
Lexus,Engine/Performance,regret the purchase regret the purchase hate the car  automatic braking hold makes the vehicle dangerous and complicated to operate safely
Lexus,Engine/Performance,take it from someone who owns a shop let me first say that all cars will break down i own a shop that specializes in european cars bmwmercedesjaguarland roverand vw makes i will say that the germans sell the driving experience and handling and they have mastered that i have always told my clients to subscribe to consumer reports and you will see whos making junk and who making a great product the lexus has always been a well built car and known for its smoothness and reliability i have owned s type r xjr vanden  plas jaguars amg mercedes  series  of them and many other luxury cars bmw has major module failures horrible leaking issues turbo failurevanos solenoid failureexpansion tank failure rear seal failurecoil failuresteering angle sensor failuredsc module failurebattery cable failureinjector failure fuel pump failureand i can write a book on these horribly designed cars merc has ism failure leaves you stranded and you cant even go onto gearsteering lock failurecommand center failureexpansion tank failurecoilgasket sbcespme failure vw has turbo issues injector issues carbon build up in portswater pump leaksmain seal leaksinjector failurejaguar has timing issueshead gasket issuescooling system issues due to plastic piping gear selector failure you cant put car into gear because the rising dial fails and your strandedac vent motors fail and you cant feel your air let me tell you that the lexus may not perform as well as the german rivals but i promise you that the german cars will stay in the shop more than the mechanic does and lose value about k each year even the new jaguars are garbage the new  engine have major issues i see so many new bimmers and jaguar owners regretting there purchase within  yearmy neighbor has a ls with k milesno see if anyone you know with a bimmerjaguarvwor merc has a daily driver with over k miles and doesnt even leak oil do yourself a favor and get the lexus you wont ever buy anything from germany againand i approve this message
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,lap of luxury ahhh  if you cannot relax when in this automobile  then you need help
Lexus,Engine/Performance,best handled ls but poorer in quality the overall technology features added on this vehicle enhanced comfortableness driveability handling performance and fuel efficient over the previous ls generations however craftsmanship over some area have shown degraded quality controls ieinterior parts show symptoms of early wears and tears wind noise continued to exist even after replacement of front double layers glasses this is a disappointment for a luxury at this level nav system voice activation is terrible unable to recognize  of commands given glove compartment door is already falling apart at k miles bottom line is its a great luxury ride with some angrily imperfections
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,nav system terrible in canada do not waste your money on nav system i live in toronto and have had no end of troubles canada is an afterthought and even lexus canada will admit that the nav system is woefully inaccurate and incomplete  often advised that house number does not exist entire towns in the maritimes do not exist st andrews nb rely on this system and you will get lost and stay lost in quebec you better know the french names system frequently sends me down blind alleys and blocked streets in toronto  lexus says sorry but read fine print nice service eh
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,wind noise unacceptable comfort disapp i owned a  ls this car is not as comfortable and the wind noise is totally unacceptable the dealer has installed the factory recommended fix but my wife does not like to ride in the car because the wind noise is so bad the ls was so comfortable and quiet that i made the mistake of not road testing the ls extensively my assumption was that it would be improved that was a big mistake in contrast to the ls the lss seats are very uncomfortable after a couple of hours on the road if the factory does not come up with a fix for the wind noise this will be the last lexus that i purchase
Lexus,Price/Value,wind noise ruins the lexus experience this is a good reliable car with some nice bells and whistles but i would never call it a premier luxury car  it is one of the noisest cars i have ever owned and with its price tag and rave reviews about how quiet the car is i expected a lot more  the wind noise is terrible  it sounds like the window is cracked when driving at  or greater  lexus insulated the roof posts and replaced side windows with insulated glass but it helped very little  very annoying and it makes me cringe when i think about what i paid for it  also an annoying rattle the dealer is trying to correct with little luck so far  also very expensive to maintain   for an oil change and tire rotation
Lexus,Price/Value,wind noise not fixed the wind noise is still very excessive on the passenger side after lexus installed the fix for the issue november    out of  passengers in my car thinks the windows are not closed tightly  the wind noise is not acceptable to me for such an expensive car  this car is supposed to be quiet  lexus still claims that  my experience with this car and lexus customer service has been big dissapointment to me
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,disturbing observations i bought this vehicle based upon build quality style and value  i should have paid more attention to comfort and convenience both front seats are uncomfortable due to a support in the center of seat bottom which i did not notice during my test drive as i drive  miles a year new destinations are common place  the guidance system limits programming to voice commands once the vehicle is in motion though the system can be programmed via voice instruction this to limit distraction to the driver however the voice recognition system leaves much to be desired the reality is there are enough selections on the display screen to make this idea laughable let the driver drive
Lexus,Price/Value,wind noise problem the ls  has a manufacturing defect that allows a very noticeable wind noise that emanates from the drivers side window lexus states that there is no fix new buyers should carefully evaluate whether they want to spend  for a car with noticeable and annoying wind noise
Lexus,Price/Value,wind noise have had the car  months and in the shop twice for very loud wind noise from both front windows  after last fix by dealer noise still a bad problem called to complain and they said there is no other fix they can try i find this unacceptable on an automobile at this price level knew i should have stuck with mercedes
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,unhappy owner this is the third ls i have owned i have had  ls s and loved them i just purchased the ls  and am so disappointed i am getting about  miles in city driving and i dont drive hard or fast the wind noise is terrible at highway speeds have had electrical problems car has been a nightmare
Lexus,Engine/Performance,continual improvement i traded a   for this car  it gets plenty of looks
Lexus,Price/Value,crap i could  write a story which may not fit this page about my experience with lexus lsawd  but  decide to provide some summaries up to k regular maintenance oil change filters scheduled services base of mileage  etc no problemsk  k things get very bad this is the list of thing i fixedbreak calipers   drive shafts  both sidesupper control arms and bushings changed x  both sidesstruts mount plates both sidesswing bar leftbreak actuatorfront differential  approx repair cost
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,comfort and quiet in a luxury package this is my second lexus ls cost of ownership is minimal other than oil changes every  to  thousand miles comfort of ride and a quiet environment sets the ls apart from its competition  years into ownership and my ls rides like the day i drove it off the showroom floor
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,navigation problem very disappointed at the nav system on my new  lexus ls on several occasions the system gets confused only blocks away from final destination the red dot indication on the map at any intersection is off by about  mile very confusing to users wont allow you to input address while vehicle is moving for safety concerns but thats stupid what if i have a passenger trying to put in a new address while i am driving unnecessary constraints nav is slow to respond typing address must be done very slowly i already need a update to the nav where is it lexus
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,last of the breed the ls  as we know it  will be replaced shortly  with a a high tech version  too expensive for youngprofessionals  and too complicated for the over  crowd  the dash  interior is full of the features found on the  gs model  which was released in may   the gs isnt exactly a barn burner in terms of popularity  the lexus factory is incentivising the current ls  models  where the price is close to a  gs   or     k for a midsize bmw wanna be if you are looking for the ultimate all around  ultra quiet  concert hall on wheels with status  grab an ls while they last
Lexus,Design/Style,horrible entrertainment control panel navigation the mouse for navigating the control panel is very awkward and the menus are complicated and illogical no place for a coffee mug has two narrow coffeedrink holders but cannot put a mug with an ear and cannot remove bottom to clean it
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,not like old lexuss lexus ls should not be ranked as next to last in class to be fair it should rank last as other reviewer noted technology is totally hit or miss usually it doesnt workbluetooth connection with phone navigation voice commands etc visibility quite poor for anyone over  uncomfortable seats dealer and manufacturer support non existent this is not the lexus of old
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,disappointing loved my  thought upgrading to get new technology would be an improvement  but so many things have been disappointing  the navigation system is a disaster with the remote mouse  bmwmercedesaudi idrive like are much easier to use  forget about voice control  doesnt work  keyless entry sometimes works sometimes doesnt  impossible to debug because it is intermittent  have the f sport where the front seats are very uncomfortable  back is too narrow unless youre a very small person  both bmw and mercedes  have adjustments  lexus doesnt  also so many features that the german cars have and lexus doesnt in this flagship car massage front seats contour seats self parking surround cameras
Lexus,Engine/Performance,unbelievable reliability this is my th lexus and all performed very well my major complaint with my  ls is the very dangerous way the driver is required to take hisher eyes of the road to navigate around the dashboard with a mouse
Lexus,Design/Style,disappointing for the money i traded my  ls for the  the older  seemed much more of a luxury car in style roominess and feel the gas mileage on the  is awful and exterior style is not distinctive enough to set it apart as a luxury car it looks like a car costing k rather than the sticker k
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel, lexus ls l   love it second ls for us previous  ls w  miles and did have some issues w suspension reliability but otherwise bullet proof  ls luxury package longwheel base is a real cruiser loads of power owned now for mos wo any complaints mark levstereo is a dream recent cross country trip was shocked to look down to notice speedo  mph by mistake on open road and ride was effortless and under total control scary quiet  best mileage at  was mpg figured by hand  still discovering buttons and features
Lexus,Price/Value,sc  ive bumped on something a few times
Lexus,Engine/Performance,head gasket fail k cant believe i need a head gasket at k changed oil regligously after looking on the web it appears this is a common occurrence with this engine
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,fsport not comfortable i want to begin my review by saying the cth f sport is a good car but it is not comfortable especially if you drive long distances stay away from the fsport the bucket seat design offers no support despite the built in lumbar support and once i highlighted the problem i have had very poor support from lexus themselves giving me contradicting information i have had a physio and an occupational health advisor state the seat is causing my back problems and had no prior problems with audi bmw ford or peugeot all cars i drove long distance i had no problems with the seat of the regular cth im curious to know if anyone else has had problems with the fsport
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,long waiting for part replacement i bought this car in august  waiting four months for its delivery on oct  my car was slightly hit from behind and required autobody repair it turns out that there is a long waiting time for part delivery i was told that it will take three weeks at least that implies that i will be without the car for at least one month taking into asccount the repair timei wouldnt advise to buy cth unless lexus will correct this unacceptable situation with part delivery
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,bad quality product buyer beware  this product is not a luxury vehicle mine has fallen apart immediately i am already out of pocket  plus to fix
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,ct h in my view the brakes on the car are defective  in emergencies  stoping the brakes go all the way to the floor  if i had accident  i will sue lexus
Lexus,Engine/Performance,luv it luv it not much not to like about this carwe got the titanium pearl with leather and navhandles beautifullyquiet inside and comfortablea little tire hum gets inside but little elsesportly looks and sporty handlingthe econormalsport selector is a bit of a gimmickthe sport mode makes the steering quicker but as far as acceleration it just affects how hard you have to push on the gas pedal to get what you wantdoesnt seem to matter if were in the city or on the freeway at consistenly get over  mpgtip in city below about  mphaccelerate moderately up to speed then back off quicklyflip it into ev batt mode and then maintain speed whenever possible
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,jumps out of awd when in snow for me awd system is not good it overheats and breaks down on roads with snow  when this happens it gets stuck permanently in wd and you need to take it to dealer  rear view is not good its a turbo so beware of the turbo lag gas milage is on average  mpg
Lexus,Design/Style,would not buy another nx  update aug  i own and drive a  rx which we bought new  we got our  nx fully loaded when it hit the market  while it seems to be a well built vehicle it dramatically lacks the plush ride of my rx  lexus changes to yokohama tires and while i cant say the issue is the tires the ride of the nx is horrible  i have played with the air pressure but nothing helps  also if you want any zoom in your driving you have to put the nx is sport mode our you will be seem to be beating a dead horse to get this little suv to move  we also have an very inoying rattle coming from the rear view mirror which can not be adjusted for anyone  ft or taller plus we had to remove the head rests from the back seats in order to see out the back window  this is a luxury grocery getter but if you plan to make any long trips spend a little more money and buy the rxupdate as of aug   lexus fixed the rattle but cant say the ride has improved  the nx is now awd which would make it attractive to anyone living in snow country  i am waiting on the yokohama tires to wear out so i can replace them with michelin tires  lexus loaned me an nx with michelins when my nx was in the shop and what a difference it made in the ride of the nx  so if you purchase one ensure you get one with michelin tires or you will be disappointed
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,dont made same miskate as i do to buy nxt just got certified  nxt with miles almost like new i purchased at black friday  less than one month i found out i this car have a serious fuel leaking issue i was driving this vehicle to endanger my family and myself with any tiny spark my car could blow up and i wont even imagine the consequence lexus park place dealership only asking me if i have hit something or if i am driving properly only pointing finger to me like its my fault it has fuel leaking issue i only use this car from mon thru fri for commute purpose only someone did not inspect the case properly and now this is on me now my concern is will this happen again is safe to drive this model the only thing that dealership offered it was  we will fix for you of course duhtell me something that i dont know please managers response not very helpful do yourself a favor if you want to purchase a luxury vehicle there are plenty brand out there but not lexus
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,infotainment system is very dangerous maddening and very dangerous   we own a  rx and had no issues  this thing is trying to kill me it connects and disconnects phone then tells you the problem is in your phoneyeah righti believed it the first few times and got so distracted trying to get phone to work i almost crashed several timesright after i hang up on a callnext one wont worksometimes the cursor jumps around on its ownits mostly front wheel drive not true awdmassive torque steerhave contacted dealer and there is no fix even finding out if the stereo is on is horribly complicated one pushes the button and waitsseveral secondsfor it to tell you the unit was on but you just turned it offhuh  perhaps my run with toyota since  is over
Lexus,Engine/Performance,final catch after chasing many i had been looking for a midsize suv with an engine lower than  liter  i looked at toyota hiighlander too big for two of us with  liter engine and too big for us with a  liter engine which would have to work hard to drive the same size vehicle as  liter  i also looked at  runner ford suvs acura too expensive with transmission problems and mazda just sold one  i did not even know that lexus has a new nxt turbo model  i was looking for a  again too big an engine for these days with new technology of getting the same performance from smaller engines  it was a coincidence that i ran into my nxt and realize what a catch it is
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,new lexus nx wife just traded in her acura zdx so the move to a smaller lighter suv was somewhat interesting purchased with all options i can already see the learning curve may take some time with so many electronic features however using the voice commands certainly softened the blow from the showroom we took the car on a  mile trip even with the ac on the car ran right at  mpg it took about  miles to really get the feel i was amazed that i enjoyed driving in eco mode and very pleased there were no more blind spots as we had with the zdx the steering may feel a bit loose until you get used to it hate hate hate the gps in fact the entire key pad thing stinks  gas mileage still decent

Lexus,Engine/Performance, lexus nx f sport  mi review
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,little to love i had my heart set on getting my rx but when i got there i learned that it got bigger wider and heavier why  it was not a perfect midsize car anymore so i got the nx but was disappointed i was fine test driving it around the corner but not loving after the first full day driving and owning it it needs to be taller and a little bigger  the analog clock is fine then i thought there was a digital clock at least on the navigation but no also there was less safety options on the nx than the rx has to offer i felt that i settle for a little too much for the nx  its my first luxury car but it might be my last lexus

Lexus,Engine/Performance,the right stuff as in pulls hard right the steering is horrible the vehicle alignment throws you to the curb especially on wet surfaces according to two different dealerships the car is within spec this is a car that is all for show definitely not performance and i opted for the f sport if you are an enthusiast stick with the germans or brits the pursuit of perfection far from itupdate since the above mentioned issue lexus of tampa bay went above and beyond to handle correcting the issue all  south florida locations i visited either inspected the car and retutned it with condescending andor bogus explanations or outright refused to look at the car the worst offender being jm lexus lexus of tampa were the only one interested in pleasing a customer in summation once corrected the car has indeed been pleasing to drive but it is more or less just for turning heads and getting attention if you are a toyota brand enthusiast get a v camary or a lexus is and save s of thousands the early experience poor customer service from corporate and time that i had to invest in order to correct a factory issue they tried to ignore has made me a one time only toyotalexus brand buyer

Lexus,Comfort/Interior,not a great car ive owned one for a year and ive nothing but annoying problems  most are loud rattles and squeaks that the dealer cant seem to fix even though they hear them  the passenger seat shudders with every bump if unloaded  the car has been a complete nightmare and i dont recommend it to anyone unless you dont mind constant loud squeaks and other unwelcome noises  the car had more minor problems than most ive owned  as an example the left headlight washer didnt retract grease kept smearing along the passenger side window and the carpet had to be replaces just because of missing ring for the rug anchor  im very disappointed in lexus for their failure to find a solution

Lexus,Price/Value,a very fragile suv extensive use of plastic body parts makes this vehicle very susceptible to damage and very expensive repairs the slightest encounter with road debris will cause body parts to separate this type of damage cannot be repaired requiring both parts to be replaced which is very expensive this is my last rxh
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,waste of money i am extremely disappointed in my purchase of  lexus rxh  i put approx k miles and the mpg is a joke at mpg average  the electric hybrid does not work in excess of  mph  in addition the emergency brake is positioned badly at the left leg shin  the vehicle i purchase sat on the lot for over  days  do not take any vehicle that has been sitting around this long i would definitely not recommend this vehicle
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,comfort premium fuel
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,reliable and dependable
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,thinking of going green  dont bother i recently traded my  lexus es for a  rx hybridwhat a huge mistakethe estimated mileage on the sticker is no where close to what the vehicle actually gets i paid a premium to get a hybrid and im getting  average miles per gallon my es  got  mpg averagelexus has really disappointed me with this false interpretation of hybrid performancei asked my dealer lexus of tampa bay today what i could dothey said to call lexuswhat a jokeim a repeat customer that has referred several buyers to this dealership and they blew me offi sincerely hope that taking the time to post this review will sufficiently warn othersjay
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,major problems returned car integrity of cabin compromised  unsure if due to postearthquake radioactive stuff or use of cosmolinelexus denies use of cosmoline but service dept at dealer claimed this toxic substance was used noxious fumesdealership would not test under similar circumstances my wife and child ill returned car within month with  penaltydealer wanted to help but lexus company uncooperativelexus left me no alternative  i shall now consider federal and state regulatory authorities litigationin unlikely case lexus stands behind product i will updatebut lexus corporate was bureaucraticdealership had changed story many times  such as  that noxious fumes would burn off
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,the gps  i rate my car excellent in every respect except one  you are not informed whether your destination is approaching on the right or left when you input an address using a home computeredestinationor you use the destination assist feature this is not only annoying but could be dangerous for obvious reasons
Lexus,Design/Style,an ugly duckling we were going to trade in our  rx for  model when we first saw it we assumed that it was not finished or was in an accident have the lexus designers consulted with the mad hatter in our mind lexus always stood for understated elegance and classic lines but no more it is not just loud it is plain ugly so we are going back to a mercedes or perhaps will consider bmw or audi sadly good bye lexus
Lexus,Design/Style,sport seats are miserable if you are  waist love the car hate the front seats the bolster on either side is rigid and relatively high pointed compared to other bolsters so a big person sits on the bolster instead of between the bolster these high rigid bolsters press against the sciatic nerve making it very uncomfortable after about  minutes small people dont seem to have a problem there is no way around it even with cushions that ultimately defeat the value of the acheated seats lexus customer no service told me if they have enough comments they will consider a design change in future vehicles but as for now nothing they canwill do
Lexus,Design/Style,ugly front end horrible looking front end looks like lexus engineers dont know how to finish this side of the vehicle so they add big chip looking plastic mash for everything else i give  stars
Lexus,Price/Value,surprised at low resale we have taken very good care of our  lexus rxh the past  years second owner low miles no accidents garagedect we have been looking at the value of our h on edmunds and kellysshock that we are already under loan value and we put down several thousand at purchase to cover the gap very disappointed and this hybrid never met its promised mpgs either
Lexus,Design/Style,ride hard stiff jolting ride  very uncomfortable if there are any imperfections in the road surface  lexus destroyed the beautiful h to create this mobile design error typical stupidity was to put the only front  v outlet in a cavern under  boxes  duh  why not a second convenient one  the only thing luxurious about the h is the price it is our rd and last lexus unless they replace our suspension system it is sad to see great soft riding comfortable suvs rx series   be trashed so badly in   after  months the car has  miles on it because our honda truck is far more comfortable  the lexus is history next year
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,poor fuel economy i have had this  lexus rxh for about  months one thing disappointments me is the actual mileage i am getting i use it for commute from home to work in san francisco so far the total mileage is  i have been getting  mpg in city and  mpg in the city my combined average mpg is  mpg the advertised fuel efficiency is  mpg on highway and  mpg in the city not sure it is just my car or it is the city that has lots of hill and traffic signal my round trip from home to work is  miles one reason we want to switch from our  bmwci which runs  mpg to this car is hoping to save gas i have not bring this car to long trip yet will test that out later
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,disappointed mpg i am very disappointed in our fuel economy  after  miles we average  mpg  suburbanrural ohio mom running a  teen family  no special driving of any sort  quite a bit different from the  combined mpg we were represented with  not worth it
Lexus,Engine/Performance,great car but performance lacking when i decided to buy an suv i knew it would be lexus quality and i so badly wanted a hybrid to future proof against rising gas prices  i created spreadsheet showing the rxh vs rx could pay for itself in yrs  intellectually i had justified the cost  however when i drove both cars h first then  i was shocked by the sluggish performance of the h relative to the peppy   the gas pedal felt squishy sluggishly responsive getting up to highway speed felt tenuous  major disappointment
Lexus,Engine/Performance,st hybrid previous lexus owner had my previous  rx in for an oil change and drove the  rx  i went ahead and placed the st order with money and got the exact car i wanted on the st delivery  what a technological marvel   i truly dont believe there is any competition in its price class with this much performance luxury safety features and economy  i plan on keeping this car till the batteries fail probably about  years
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,simply delivers lexus quality and luxury throughout
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,poor fuel economy very disappointedfuel economy well below the epa estimateshad i known i would only get mpg i wouldnt have wasted my money on the hybrid versiondefinitely feel cheatedpoor design of back seatsthere is a large gap between the back seats that is both a safety hazzard and is unsightlypoor design of navigationcomputer as unable to perform many functions when the vehicle is in motionwindshield wiperswasher has poor coverage of the front windshieldunable to close off outside air when the defroster is engaged
Lexus,Design/Style,weird  second delay when accelerating a few things when accelerating in the ist theres an odd delay that you no longer feel with other brands ive test driven this reminds me of old technology turbos so pulling out into traffic isnt as confidence inspiring as one may expect also the car i test had the plastic mesh material from c pillar hanging there and a rubber seal on the door loose i was extremely disappointed as ive heard mainly great things about lexus quality the paint on the exterior of my friends  flat black is really scratched i asked him why he stated he takes it to the car wash so again not impressed with the overall quality ive since driven the  i and the  audi a they seem much more surefooted as well as the cabin materials are constructed as youd expect i havent made a decision on my vehicle yet however the lexus ist left me pining for more as i thought it would be the clear winner i left the dealership rather disappointed
Lexus,Engine/Performance,poor acceleration from a stop we leased this car for my wife and she has been very disappointed when merging into traffic from a stop it has a  second delay which at times makes it very unsafe since she is never accelerating hard to  its overall speed does not matter as much as a daily driver in heavy stop and go traffic we would not recommend this car
Lexus,Engine/Performance,slow acceleration i trade an is  for t i am disappointed with the acceleration of my t the car takes around  to  seconds to accelerate after press the accelerator pedal i called lexus usa and they referred me to the dealer i called the dealer and they referred me to lexus usa has anyone one experience this issue
Lexus,Price/Value,mybadasslexus just buy it
Lexus,Price/Value,try trading in i purchased hs  h last year with  a price tag of i am not totally happy with the rideso i looked into upgrading to gs or rxi was offered  as trade in value for a car with this is not the value i expected from a lexus
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,after  days i am on my rd jump start this is unreal purchase date wednesday  car had  miles on it on sunday  at  am i needed my first jump  had to call road side assistance at  pm while at the mall same day i needed a second jump start  then only to find that the dealership was not open on sunday so the car could not be towed on monday  again my brand new car would not start i then needed a third jump  after complaining to the dealership they stated they were going to bring me a new battery  they then called back as said no battery was in stock  i am now driving a loaner vehicle this has been by far the worst car buying experience ever
Lexus,Engine/Performance,not a camry or prius ive owned mine now for about  weeks i came from a  prius which was too low to the ground for my back problems ironically the dimensions are almost identical but for some reason the hs seats are higher and the car is easier to get in and out of i also owned a camry hybrid for about  months hated it the gas mileage was terrible the quality was awful and the door sill was low and i frequently bumped my head getting in and out im  i dont have any of those problems with the hs as for luxury and quality and ride  top notch made in japan camry made in kentuckyi think my biggest complaint is lack of storage space up front and the engine whine when braking
Lexus,Engine/Performance,not satisfied dash board is made of poor quality material many of owners are complaining that they have cracks because of hot and cold weather   cylinder engine has poor mpg rear seats area has poor leg room extremely poor customer service
Lexus,Price/Value, is valve spring problem with the exception of horrible visibility especially when backing up and changing lanes i loved my is at about  thousand miles i started to experience a shutter when coming to a stop intermittently i had it in the shop twice for the problem and they told me there were no error codes and it may have been bad gas my car is now at  thousand miles and needs the valve springs replaced this is the same problem that there was a recall for on the is and a few other lexus models a few months ago i think they need to add the  to that recall
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,cant wait to change very comfortable ride for a small car ive had it almost  years no major problems front wheels a lot of dust brakes im  so i need a lot of leg room to drive there is only enough room for a small kid to ride in the back seat behind me why does this car have such a big trunk but no space in the back seat  every time i reverse the wheels squeak so much i dont have even  miles yet ive been using plus gas anything higher is a waste of money many times i smell something overheating from the clutch it has been checked by the dealer they found nothing the service at the lexus dealer is too expensive for oil change basic service etc i go to toyota its cheaper
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,worst car i ever had this is without a doubt the worse car i ever had cant wait until the lease is up the visibility is horrible i cant see where am going specially if you are trying to back up the low profile tires are horrible i have spent over  on tires and the car has less than  miles you feel every bump on the road terrible ride
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,big disappointment my wife and i have been leasing an is for  years it is very hard for me to decide where to start my review of this car since it has been the worst car i have ever experienced  we fell for the good sporty looks and the large screen navigation system it has unfortunately the joy ended after a few days of driving it on the road in real life  let me tell you this car has the worst ride you can imagine you feel every pebble on the road after a long ride you literally feel nauseated we both are only  tall and we still feel cramped in this car the seats are small and it is very difficult to find a comfortable seating position in this car the wind noise is really bad too
Lexus,Engine/Performance,pursuit of barely average have approximately  miles on car bought new from lexus dealer in tires have never held pressure always have to refill tires every month or sooriginal tires had to be replaced after only  mileslexus was no help  claimed oem tires were high performance tiresnow on rd set of tiresoverall build quality does not measure up to quality in lexus models further up the food chainhave owned  earlier lexus models this will be my lastbought a used  infiniti mx that now has over  miles on it with zero problems  im switching to infiniti
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,big disappointment this was my first luxury car purchase and what a disappointment i spent over  thousand for this car and it makes rattling noise by the front doors by the radio area and the shifteri have brought the car back to the dealers numerous times and they are unable to fix it one of the consultant told me they cant do anything about iti call the  customer service number and it has been several weeks since i got a follow up return call on their so call investigationlousy car and lousy customer servicedont buy this car save your money for some other luxury carthis is one of my biggest regret to spend tons of money on a car that is mediocre in the quality
Lexus,Engine/Performance,follow up so i wrote about my car back in february of last year this is an update after the list of issues i had with the car from the moment i bought it brand new the final straw was when the car wouldnt start with one try then once it started it wouldnt accelerate at k miles i took it to the dealer who told me it was a faulty battery  months later did the same thing towed it to the dealer they told me it was a fluke they couldnt repeat it and to bring it back in when it repeats it i ended up trading it in for a mercedes gl i figured i couldnt do any worse in reliablity than what i hadi would not recommend this car to anyone
Lexus,Engine/Performance,a few concerns i purchased my car usedwapprox  miles on it   problems started the battery is new but one time the door would not open once i got it open wthe key it wouldnt start  had to get a jump lexus dealer could not find problem  a few times ive had to push the start button several times to get it started im going to replace the battery anyway brakes sound like an old wooden ship  pads and whatever have been replaced door hesitates to open at times  acceleration poor my confidence in this car is shrinking
Lexus,Comfort/Interior, lexus is  awd certified review paid k for awd certified with k miles this is my first car ever purchased this is a sexy fun to drive car the selection process is simple pick your power hp or hp navino navi  pick your colors  many safety features the average joe wouldnt notice  bad posture  fat reargut  car seems small  common problems that have solutions small back seat  buy a gs brake dust  low dust ceramic pads horse power  give up awd for is rwd  h
Lexus,Comfort/Interior, review i purchased this vehicle new in  and have written several reviews at different mileages  i did not have any problems with the vehicle until  miles when i discovered that the floor mats were wet from an air conditioner leak  apparently the  lexus is series has a defective air conditioner drain that obstructs and pours water into the interior cabin causing major problems  the design problem was corrected in   there has not been a recall on the problem and the dealer agreed to replace the drain and all of the interior carpets under warranty  the repair would ordinarily cost over  since it requires removal of the entire dash board and all of the interior carpets
Lexus,Engine/Performance,shattered high hopes  the auto that i purchased was a nightmare i had to buy tires after one year the radiator had a leak although i never saw where it was i reported the problem to the lexus dealership and i was told that there was a problem that was discovered with the radiator and that it would be replaced if i was still covered by my warranty well i wasnt and as a result i often drove without any heat estimated cost   after a year i had to have the fuel injectors cleaned cost  i complained repeatedly complained about a ticking noise coming from the engine i was told that that was normal after two years and  miles i was told that my valve springs were failing
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,fun car but driver seat is crippling i have had this car for   years  it is a beautiful car and mine did not have any quality problems  it is fun to drive though the acceleration and cornering could be better  i usually have  or  people in the car so the tiny back seat is not an issue   few things to be aware of the wheel well on the drivers side is narrow and has a protuberance that forces me to sit at an uncomfortable angle  i have a hipsi joint problem that i think the car contributed to second thing warning lights are extremely annoying  even for something trivial like a low tire  and the low tire warning goes off a lot for silly reasons like temperature changes  and only the dealer can turn it off
Lexus,Engine/Performance, mile review i have driven my  lexus is  for  miles  i purchased the vehicle new in   the computer indicates the average gas mileage for  miles is  miles per gallon highway gas mileage is as high as  mpg when driving  mph  i have been using mid grade gasoline and the mileage and performance is the same as premium grade i back off the accelerator when possible to increase the gas mileage  the car has the original brakes and tires  the front brakes need to be replaced but the tires still have at least  miles left on them  the car has been extremely reliable since a few initial glitches no major repairs to anything
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel, mile review i have owned my  is  since october   the vehicle has been driven  miles and still has the original factory tires and brake pads  my average gas mileage according to the computer is   the vehicle has been extremely dependable i hope to drive it  miles  i had an initial problem with oil dripping onto an exhaust manifold from a loose dip stick tube the problem has not reccurred the tires are a little loud but that is probably why they have lasted so long  the brakes sometimes squeal when backing up and they turn the front wheels black in a short period of time the car brakes well with no fade the paddle shifters work well for downshifting from overdrive
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,runs ok but squeaks and rattles the interior is plagued with annoying squeaks and rattles sunroof dashboard door panels visors glove compartment seat belt adjusters they all squeak or rattle and tend to come and go as if possessed if these things annoy you then stay away because its no fun to drive  seats feel like youre sitting on throw pillows on a bench  too soft and poor support
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,overall goodbut need to fix some flaws the car do have some flaws in itthe bluetoothbt works from only one speakeri thought that it could be fixed but later learned that thats how the lexus bt works it is little frustrating i saw the bt in the other cars like in bmw benz in honda the voice comes form all the speakers and thats how i like it  in my car secondly i keep hearing some irritating sounds coming form the steering side of the dashboard i also noticed the same in the other is loaner car and the funny thing is even the dealers own car has that problem every time i go to the dealer i complain about it and they come back saying that they found nothing i feel its had to do with the materials used in the dashboard
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,nothing but problems well im not satisfied at all i bought a  lexus is  months ago and i took a chance on this because there is no local dealer i live hrs away unfortunately ive had nothing but problems with it  ive gone through  tires breaks and a factory recall on the exhaust system in that time ive been to springfield twice and to the toyota dealership  times now i bought a car almost brand new i shouldnt had to bring it in i brought my car in last week to get the breaks looked at the local toyota place and the rep told me i had another bad tire  so i called lexus and told them  when i purchased the car i got the tire warranty but they said they wouldnt pay for the tire
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,overall i like the is  awd for a  cyl car gas mileage is terrific  very comfortable especially the adjustable heated and cooled seats  i dont drink coffee in the car so cup holders are not an issue however i definitely would like to see a decent coin holder  my is  now has  miles on it and the dash sounds like it is going to fall off in my lap the squeaks and rattles in the dash are very very annoying and not expected in a vehicle of this supposed quality  overall i do like the car however i dont expect that i will keep it the  years i initially thought i would when i bought it
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,way below expectations this car has single handedly deteriorated my impression of lexus quality my car has  miles and has had to have the brake pads replaced due to excessiveconstant squeeling after normal flat terrain driving  the front dash has an irritating popping noise constantly that sounds like expansion which im told is normal and to simply accept it and we had to bring it in twice to try to findaddress a rattling noise in the front driver dash  while the service dept is great  wouldnt it be better if i didnt have to go in unnecessarily to begin with  very disappointed  will likely not buy a lexus again
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,is this a lexus  rattles and lumpy seat overall car has been great but i am concerned over the interior quality of the plastic and seats  lots of rattles coming from the dash area around the navi and entire dash  have been to several dealers to fix the squeaking and one dealer lifted off the entire dash and reset  now the rattles are even worse  the front seat has developed a large lump where the fan unit is located so sitting is very uncomfortable to say the least  i am really shocked over all the issues with a k car and to make matters worse lexus corporate has not responded to my concerns and the dealer has stated this is the best we can do  i hope they will resolve but i am doubtful now
Lexus,Engine/Performance,great car but im in a dilemma im in toronto had it just after boxingday great car indeed but the reason why i went for lexus was for quality and quiet rides to my disappointment theres significant tire noise i got  dunlops especially at highway speed bumpy rides add noise to interior got to turn up the stereo in order to enjoy my classical music hurts my ears at the end of trip faint squeaky noise from interior panels doors dash somewhere at rear very small armrest storage jumpy tranny in slow traffics at st  nd gear it seemed confused thinking of trading it in with an es  too bad sorry to say these negative things but theyre facts should test drive it for a full day
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,car shutters when moonroof retracted serious flaw in the moonroof when fully retracted car vibrates and shakes something awful usually happens when the car is traveling around  to  mph only way to stop this is to close moonroof halfway
Lexus,Design/Style,big disappointment i traded in a audi a for the is and have been quite disappointed  the transmission is rough when shifting it has no get up and go and the blind spots are huge  i find myself having to look around a lot more in this car and am way more cautious after several near collisions because of the blind spots the audi was fun to drive  the is is a chore  im getting rid of it after only  year
Lexus,Price/Value,overall very good but all in all a very good deal i agree with all the positive features mentioned elsewhere i read somewhere about an annoying noise from the dashboard that starts few months after having the car and i actually noticed that its from the drivers corner of the dashboard a highpitch annoying noise that occurs most on unsteady roads i play music loud while driving and that can masks it but a real disappointment
Lexus,Design/Style,lexus is  awd   technology i leased a new lexus is  awd after being told that the new model been updated for   yes there are some minor styling and other changes but its still a  technology platform  for example the navigation system has no text to speech no traffic info outdated maps poor routing  you could do better with a portable unit for

Lexus,Price/Value,just passed k miles well i just passed the k miles goal i looked at my comments from  so i am driving about k miles every  years the car is holding up well my air suspension failed on the front and rear in the last  months but those are the only real problems it cost about  each to fix but seeing that i have owned the car  years that is minor considering i have had other no major repairs my next goal is k i will write back again

Lexus,Engine/Performance,rusting and peeling paint  inch rust bubble at the drivers side roof meets the windshield  the paint is peeling at two places on top of the rear bumper  i have to check if these items are covered by warranty but i doubt it i never expected these items to happen to a lexus i live in california  the air conditioner is also weak even though it has been recharged and checked  i had to cut the factory floor mat as it was too close to the accelerator even with the tabs the floor mat would depress the accelerator the engine gunned once and i saw the floor mat against the accelerator i sent in a complaint but got nowhere check your mat  bad gas pedal design as the mat cannot slide under the pedal

Lexus,Engine/Performance,think about it before you buy this car if you are a driver this is not your car transmission control is poorly designed hurts economy and has safety issues as it coasts too quick to downshift on slight inclines driver has no control handling feel is not too bad pushed hard exhibits roll front drive in any car has handling problems this car is powerful and has torque steer that can take the car in dangerous directions if pushed hard from a dead stop be prepared if hard acceleration is planned or required  inside lighting is extremely poor design goof again paint may be thin and prone to scratches do not have the dealer service charges are x what you can by at a service shop
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,certified only buy a certified used car
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,it is a toyota with below par electronic this car is sold as a luxury vehicle but after owning it for  while we realized nothing is luxury about it except the grittiness of the company and the dealership basically this is a toyota with a little better paint job outdated electronic and very frustrated entertainment system most disappointing is the outrages maintenance prices  for an oil change and  a yearly charge if you want your navigation system to be updated personally i would not recommend buying this car
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,granny from pasadena if buying used check repair records
Lexus,Price/Value,dashboard awful  lexus support non existent august  update  lexus replaced the dash at no cost to me  therefore i am once again happy with the  lexus es   the car has k miles and has had no issues except for the dashboard  the dashboard is deteriorating  it is sticky and has a bad glare  lexus extended the warranty through may  but i did not receive the notice  i have been trying to get local lexus dealership to help  the local dealer told me it is out of their hands and i must deal with lexus corporate  corporate has basically given me the run around  they admitted there is a problem with the dashes but said they cannot warranty the defect forever  i explained that i did not receive the notification and never imagined it was an existing problem with lexus  toyota cars until searching the internet for solutions  i am very disappointed in lexus corporates lack of concern and the local dealer basically saying they cannot help

Lexus,Engine/Performance,engine noise and ac problems i have had  cars in my lifetimethe last five were the lexus      since lexus became a carthis  has  major problems which lexus has not been able to correct the engine makes a noise when cold that sounds like the tappet noise of previous years the engine idles roughlexus tells me it is the fuel injectors and is normalmy  nissan altima was quieter and did not make this type noise or rough idle the ac covers my dash board area with tiny white specslexus has change the evaporator twice and ac filters numerous timesit is still spewing and i think it might be causing me a health problem with my lungsi really am disappointed in the year
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,this car is all over the place bought the car in  needless to say im very disappointed the car has a nice looking exterior great stereo and terrific gas miles  plus that is where it ends since the first month i noticed paint chipping and scratches i thought is was bad road luck then more started appearing along with blotching i barely drive the car and never on dirt roads its garage kept i have a hyundai with k that gets driven every day and no front chips or scratches the seats are very uncomfortable and feel like your sitting in a hole i have always had rattles in dash and under carriage and door seat position buttons have always had problems and now dont work plus poor int lite  button design
Lexus,Engine/Performance,like budduh i purchased my  es  after totaling my cadillac sts  this is a nearperfect balance of comfort quiet ride economy performance amenities and quality
Lexus,Price/Value,its just a pricey toyota very disappointing vehicle  i was looking for an upscale car that would offer low cost of ownership  this car has been very expensive to maintain and has required some costly repairs including brakes and rotors very poor lighting in the cabin at night  even the kids complain about the lack of lights  switches are not backlit so finding the right switch is difficult  the temperature controls are absolutely horrible  has independent temp control for passenger and driver but there is no correlation between what you set and what it delivers  its as though the sensor is on the outside and not in the cabin  the voice recognition for the phone is mediocre at best paint chipping on hood
Lexus,Price/Value,poor gps i have owned several es in the past but this is the first with gps  i agree it is not up to par with the competition and i have been test driving many vehicles over the past couple of months  the voice command response is terrible and not worth the effort  blue tooth has been fine  biggest complaint is that gps does not allow even a passenger to enter info while the car is in motion  very frustrating as voice commands for navigation are not worth the effort
Lexus,Engine/Performance,expected better bought the car as a certified unit at k miles  rattles in the dash and drivers door almost immediately  loud knocking from injection system im told when the engine is cold parts of the car sound tinny when bumped or doors are shut hard  poor lighting inside and particularly in the rear seat area  console storage is poor due to unusual access method the door panels and door sills should be something other than plastic which is easily marked during entry and exit  carpet would be nice  not up to the quality of design i expected from lexus
Lexus,Engine/Performance,snow performance definitely not a snow car  first real snow test  very poor performance  perhaps snow tires would make difference
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,transmission brakes tires and rattles i have had transmission problems from the beginning and at every  mile check i have complained to the dealer no help from them brakes are bad and two separate rattles have developed one in the dash and one when the moon roof is open the brakes are bad at  miles as are the tires which i am told need replacing
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,lexus platinum serviceuntil you need it transmission was bad off showroom floor it was my wifes car and i never drove it and would not believe her lexus transmission was bad until we took it in for service at  miles transmission jump in first almost caused my wife to rear end car in stop  go traffic the transmission had to be replaced requiring entire motor  front end to be dropped out from underneath not a happy camper
Lexus,Price/Value,overpriced for value test drive a lot of other cars and dont be swayed by the looks wish i had purchased something else for the price i paid
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,inferior seating material on a  mile road trip you will notice how lexus cut corners the pleather armrest irritated my elbow so bad that on the way back from miami i had to buy a hand towel to cover armrest to keep elbow from hurting never had this issue on road trips in my mercedes or jaguar
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,bad leather seats before you purchase a lexus their  interior leather is the worst i have ever seen in a so called luxury car have a  and have already had to replace the seat covers the perforated inserts just plain ripp had to pay  per seat to replace just the cushions expected much better and they say normal wear and tear  years and ripps kia has a better interior than this at th of the price beware

Lexus,Comfort/Interior,first foreign car this is our first foreign made auto this  es  so far is very nice for what we paid were a little disappointed with the bamboo interior the seats appear to be turning dark at the perforated holes in the seat i was advised to use simple green to clean it but i afraid this may change the color or make it worst please advise if anyone else have this problem

Lexus,Service/Maintenance, lexus es  hvac system does not work properly  after the temperature reached setting number auto  deg cold air start to blow in your face head  lexus does not recognized the problem cant fix it
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,headrest issues prevent a sale this automobile was on my short list now after several years i am finally prepared to purchase a car that will last me for the next  years overall i was very pleased with the  es ultra luxury sedan and would have plugged the trigger and made the purchase however due to the terribly designed headrest in this car i will sadly have to pass what a shame the car is everything i need and want unfortunately there really is no way for me to be comfortable while driving i tend to sit fairly erect when i drive and the headrest makes me very uncomfortable i am  now i am considering my other choice  toyota avalon limited of course it will lack several luxury touches but the headrest is not as intrusive as the es i wish lexus would make an adjustable headrest that you could adjust an inch or two backwards i know this is for safety but i feel certain that i am not the only person that feels this way
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,unhappy with   lexus es rides like a truck if you have owned a  or  lexus do not expect the same comfort inside or on the road the seats are hard road noise inside is bad and i am very dissatisfied with its over all ride and comfort and road noise mine rides just a tad above my husbands  dodge truck i dont know what happened to the quality but i am very unhappy with my new  lexus es i did not test drive it and that was a big mistake however i did not test drive my  or  and i am m not sure a simple test drive would  have been enough to tell me how uncomfortable this  was going to be i trusted since i was buying a high end car like the lexus it would be of a quality i had known before i am looking for a  or earlier used lexus and will sell this one i just hate that lexus has fallen into the cheap car routine why not have leather seats i dont want a sports car i want a car that is comfortable very displeased with this new car would not recommend unless a person wants an sports rcar
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,falling behind my biggest disappointment is the avrg  mpg in totally flat streets and highways in south florida not even close to the sticker  mpg the center arm rest is difficult to slide open the phone and ipod connections are inconveniently inside the center console the side mirrors automatically point to the ground in reverse making it impossible for one to see approaching cars or obstacles on both sides other than those on the ground hardly any space to hide or place objects this is my th and last es have not owned one in  years and seems im driving the same old lexus with new inconveniences added mats are thinner and do not match the carpet color incomplete under dash carpet
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,whats not to like drove the car from the dealers lot to home with the big red bow in the back seat as this was a present for my wife we had a  es we traded in for the  es after an initial breakin period we drove to disney world from our florida home in fort myers needless to say the three hour trip was smooth quiet and thoroughly refeshing as one expects from the lexus upon arrival at our hotel we were greeted by the bell staff at the front entrance to unload the luggage and check in they admired the cars exterior and interior as they helped us unload on the road we also received admiring glances from other motorists as well as when we parked
Lexus,Engine/Performance,not like previous es cars the current es is not you fathers car too bad it is not i have owed five of these cars and this one does not meet previous expectations it drives like an rav the road performance could be better the ride is not as soft and cushiony as previous cars you will feel every bump on back roads and roads that are not perfectly paved for that reason i am disappointed overall it is quiet and has plenty of power although there is a slight delay remember this is not the inline six as before my guess is the is engineers got ahold of this car instead of the ls engineers and did it their wayfinally gave up on the cars ride i tried the  but it drove the same i then drove a buick lacrosse the buick drives just like the old es did i bought it and dont think i will go back to lexus
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,disappointed after owning my es  with ultra luxury package for  months i am truly disappointed several rattles have developed in the doors dashboard and sunroof when washing the car water accumulates inside of the rear taillights overall im dissatisfied in the build quality of the new es
Lexus,Engine/Performance,rumble and grumble never fixed and lexus never i bought my es feb  on the th it developed a shakerumbling when in drive or reverse the noise and shake are absolutely not what lexus should be the dealer tried and said nothing found on the first visit the second try they had the lexus repengineer from atlanta look and he replaced one of the engine mounts it was improved but still not right now at k miles the vibration and sound is getting worse the service mgr rode with me and called the lexus rep in atl who said it was normal beware test drive any es and watch for the shake and noise do not buy the lexus i hate my lexus and will be out of it as soon as im not upside down update lexus never provided help or a solutioni traded the lexus and am much happier
Lexus,Comfort/Interior, es disappointing on the inside this is our third esdisappointed in what lexus did to save a few bucksfor example the cd changer is gone replaced by single disc the holder for sunglasses above the console  gone the various console cubbies for storage  gone lighting above each rear seat on each side  goneash tray and lighter plug gone  lost that plugfront seats are narrowerthe car just feels tighter on the insidewith the lighting changes and the deletion of the cd changer lexus has cheapened the interior the trunk is not as easy to get stuff into because it is a deeper accesscargo net is installed with bolts  makes it hard to get to the spareshd have just bought out the  lease
Lexus,Design/Style,radio is horrible i like the car except for the radio it fade out and even becomes static they know about the problem but wont do anythingthe antenna is in the back window and you cant tint the windows because they told me the radio will even work worst and they try to sell you extras so beware if you like the radio it wont work so well
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,i hate the expresso woodgrain this car drives like a dream the exterior color matador red mica is awesome i get compliments all the time however the interior is another story i chose black leather because i thought that the ivory interior would be too hard to maintain the black leather only comes with the espresso wood grain and not the brown walnut which is dark and along with the dark leather is visually unappealing the espresso wood grain should not have included in the first place what were they thinking in addition i dont understand why a remote start is not an option i am satisfied with everything about this car other than the two concerns mentioned above pan to change wood grain cost
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,what a disappointment since aug  i have owned  ess  first one totaled in a flood after  weeks of purchase drove well  i was very happy i replaced it with another one the cabin shook violently since day one  i drove other demo ess all had steering vibrations one worse than the other  after taking the car back to the dealer  times they finally found out that my brand new car had fixaflat in all  tires with new tires steering doesnt shake but the cabin still vibrates  all demos and loaners i drove have a cabin vibration at all speeds bad engineering flaw i am extremely disappointed  lexus was known to have the best drive
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,outofdate gps data the gps data is either outofdate about  year or incomplete the dealer didnt advise me when i purchased the car neither did the salesperson told me how to get the up todate data
Lexus,Comfort/Interior, es traded in  highlander hybrid due to poor mpg hard ride poor driver interior space and trans braking function useless when in the mountains needing lower gearing for down hill cold weather elevation  ethanol gas lowered the highlander hybrid mpg to  mpg city and low s highway looked at venza camry crosstour c e  nothing could beat the es in overall driving experience and quality for the price lexus customer sales service in purchase of the es beat everyone getting  mpg on interstate at  mph  getting  mpg driving in city beats the highlander hybrid mpg  highlander hybrid limited interior appears cheap compared to es interior
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,dont hesitate to buy after  months of researching for a vehicle for my wife i decided to buy the es trust me gents i did the research when it comes to class comfort dependability and quality this was the car we looked at bmw buick infiniti acura etc etc i do not have one buyers remorse on this purchase
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,gone to soon unfortunately   days after purchase a collision totaled this lexus es soon to be replaced by a
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,relentless pursuit of excellence i have driven lexus for  decades since my first ride in a lexus  my first two lexus each got k miles neither one of which ever needed repair other than maintenance  however my latest  es has been a major disappointment for me  the ride is so noisy a normal conversation is difficult  this is due to the  low profile tires  and i understand that i cannot without replacing the rims change tire size for a higher profile tire  i may as well purchase a new car if i was inclined to buy another lexus if i choose to buy  rims  one cannot control the climate without concentrating totally on the screen accident waiting to happen blind spots are huge  the  degree outlook on the drivers side is nearly useless unless one want to totally rely on the bsm blind spot monitor which helps nothing if one is trying to enter traffic at ones o angle another accident waiting to happen  there is no monitoring of traffic over the drivers left shoulder due to blind spot  opening and closing the trunk is a real pain when ones hands are full  i love the warmcool seats and the mileage is ok  navigation system is useless period  guess im used to an iphone
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,my lexus experience in march  i purchased a new es from sewell lexus  my reason for choosing this car is that i typically drive my cars for  years and the utmost priority for me is reliability  i was assured by sewells salesman maury erbay that i was buying the most reliable car on the road  he told me about a rare circumstance with another buyer who was unsatisfied with the maintenance history of hisher lexus and how sewell made it right miles august upon leaving the car at the airport for  days the car was dead  roadside assistance came to jump the car and i drove the car to sewell  it was sewells opinion that nothing was wrong with the car miles march  upon leaving the car at the airport for  days the car was dead  a coworker who had been traveling with me jumped my car miles september upon leaving the car at the airport for  days the car was dead  a coworker who had been traveling with me jumped my car miles december upon leaving the car at the airport for  days the car was dead  a coworker who had been traveling with me jumped my car miles march i am a conservative driver and not a hot rodder  after  my tires needed replacing  based on the price of the car it was rather shocking to learn that it was sold with tires that would be shot at  miles miles june upon leaving the car at the airport for  days the car was dead  roadside assistance came to jump the car and i drove the car to sewell exasperated by the complete unreliability of this car  i was told that lexus has just learned of a problem with the gateway ecu and mine was replaced  the service representative told me that i had not been notified of the fix because it had just been discovered in fact subsequent to my last oil change at  miles  i did some research on the internet and found that lexus had identified the problem for other owners in   i asked myself many times why there wasnt a recall for this issue but it appears that fixing an issue that causes its customers to be stranded isnt a priority for lexus  it is inconceivable to me that sewell prides itself on service yet they were aware of this problem and did nothing to fix it until i had been stranded again and brought the car to sewell  because of the multiple unnecessary drains on my battery i insisted that the battery be replaced  sewell resisted and finally agreed to the replacement only after a lengthy argument miles april the cars locking system failed and the drivers door actuator was replaced under warranty miles july warranty expires  miles july back seat begins to squeak loudly when no passengers are riding in the seat miles august air conditioning fails  lights illuminate but no sound from air conditioner is present and no air came from the vents  as a courtesy sewell picked up the car but found nothing wrong with the air conditioner as it started for them  however the fan was noisy and needed a new bearing which was replaced at no charge miles november the cars locking system fails again and the passengers door actuator was replaced at my cost  parts and labor  by now it appears that the other two doors are likely to fail soon as the quality of the actuators in the lexus es  is poor miles december a dull thumping noise quickly progresses from infrequent to extreme  while it sounds as if it is a suspension issue the real issue is the sunroof rattling  this repair is projected to be a  hour repair job and is not covered under warrantyas is clear from the above the car has been a maintenance nightmare  the reliability factor that was conveyed to me at the time of purchase has been completely nonexistent  never in my years of car ownership have i been stranded and stranded multiple times by any vehicle other than a lexus  it appears that the maintenance issues are becoming more frequent  one has to wonder when the last two door actuators will fail when two already haveupon discovery of the  mile problem an email was sent to sewells business manager cecily mcclarin sewells service manager mason kessner and sewells general manager dudley haralson expressing my level of unhappiness with the car and its track record of poor reliability  based on the sewell promise maury made at the time of purchase of the car i expected to hear from upperlevel management at sewell  instead i heard nothing from anyonei am prematurely near the end of my lexus journey due to poor service and poor reliability and am close to making a decision about which car i plan to buy next clearly not a lexus  no one from lexus demonstrated any effort to retain me as a customer by offering a trade on another lexus at a discount in an effort to win me back i leave as an unhappy customer determined to share my lex
Lexus,Engine/Performance,very disappointed for this es very disappointed for this es its km now i bought it for its serene and comfortable reputation this vehicle is not quite at lot the car vibrates when it stopped and the engine is engaged the vibration makes me so uncomfortable that i have to switch to neutral whenever stopping before traffic light i took it to dealer to check i was told its rotors problem i dont think thats the casebecause it vibrates also when i dont press breaker
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,not as good as everyone thinks this car was supposed to be the car that lasted forever but that is not true at all  bought it certified used from lexus with  with  mile warranty at  miles the cv joint went out do to a leak warranty covered then at  miles the motor blew up there was a crack in the short block and one of the crank bearing went out still covered under warranty but very disappointed then  weeks later i got  a letter in the mail saying that the front passenger airbag was a defective takata inflator capable of spewing shrapnel just like the gm stuff the car is also not quiet which is disappointing because i commute via the highway the leather interior is comfortable though i will never buy a toyotalexus again i have  fords that have over  miles and they are still hangin in there maybe i just got a lemmon or the previous owner did something stupid but i do not recommend you buy this vehicle despite its comfort
Lexus,Price/Value,hate this car am i the only person in the universe who bought a rattletrap  have taken it back several times but still develops more rattles  i have an  year old rx that doesnt have one rattle  very disappointed
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,how about this for a catchy titleover  over  miles and still going bought this car with  miles back in  just minor repairs since at  miles my mechanic replaced water pump all hoses and gaskets along with timing belt for  total keep in mind this was all preventive maintenance that i requested even though nothing was wrong with the car  the only negative i might improve upon is the thin leather covering the seats could be a little better quality now i am looking for another car but am hesitant to give up this car as i am worried about the quality of my next car
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,will purchase a lexus again it is reliable
Lexus,Engine/Performance,transmission break down i have  miles the transmission had failed on the freeway cost to have it fixed with a remanufactured transmission from same dealer is surprized to find this failure at  miles did not have this problem with us cars even with mileage more than are we blind sighted to the quality of lexusthis dos not complain about the failing door locks and engine light on etc
Lexus,Price/Value,bad bad car i purchased my car drove it for less then two years  i replaced the transmission in it  times and right now it this very moment i need another transmission i paid out more for transmissions than the car cost me i loved the car that is why i tried to keep it but it put me in the poor house shame on lexus
Lexus,Engine/Performance,horrible engines do not buy all i can say is do your homework  just after i rolled over  miles my engine threw a rod and now i am getting another engine put in  i ran a full synthetic oil for  miles and did not think that lexus would have problems like this with this mileage  all i can say is before you buy do your research on lexus oil gelsludge
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,will not buy another rx  we bought our rx used with very low mileage after having owned  trouble free toyotas we were shocked when the transmission of our well maintained rx failed at k miles it was an expensive and very time consuming repair as the parts were very hard to locate we still are not happy with how the transmission hunts for a gear at lower speeds cargo space is terrible interior is a bit cramped and not all that comfortable and the center console and cup holders are poorly designed and flimsyturning radius is bad and acceleration could be a lot better no more rxs for us ever

Lexus,Service/Maintenance,"bad experience i think ive got a lemon this time terrible rattle comes from the left side of the vehicle excessive wind noise at mph according to a service professional from putnam lexus the wind noise is a standard for this type of vehicle and i could get rid of it by folding the driver side mirror this car was in service several times but all the problems are still there  ive got several new ones like scratch on the bumper and ink on leather my advice test this vehicle on all types of road before purchasing and beware of the service department at putnam lexus in redwood city ca"
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,"you must test drive it at highway speeds it drives great in the city badly on the highway the front feels heavy and you have to steer it all the time it doesnt just cruise straight  the steering is progressive power steering which gets more like manual steering the faster you go feels like a truck without power steering on the highway  this makes highway driving tedious and tiring  your arm muscles are always slightly flexed like isometrics the cd and ac and heater controls are confusing and not intuitive if you lower the steering wheel you cant see the blinkers or the mirror controls the estimated gas mileage is not accurate im only getting  mpg i am very sorry i bought it"

Lexus,Engine/Performance, lexus rx common problem with this model is transmission failure at k  k well mine failed at k this is a low end lexus and would not recommend this vehicle to anyone
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,worst car ive ever owned the lexus brand is by far the greatest rip off in american history  the transmission failed at k and the car has more sensors than any car i know  we have spent over o in repair fees on this car  i can not believe the reputation gets in the media  they give the japanese car companies a bad name  beware
Lexus,Engine/Performance,worst car ever purchased i bought this car for reliability and have put so much money into repairs on this car that ive exceeded the value of the car  at  miles the transmission went out  i thought lexus built quality i have had to replace  oxygen censors at the tune of  each  the engine now leaks oil  just got new oxygen sensor last week  various other repairs  today the check engine light came on again  i am so disappointed in lexus  i contacted them about the transmission problem which s of people are having and received nothing  i thought when i bought lexus i was buying a great car that would last forever  not  u need to trade this car at
Lexus,Engine/Performance,transmission went at  transmission went at  warranty is kyrs and lexus sticks to those numbers  this is a lowend basic toyota transmission that lexus loaded up with weight and gadgets  we know lots of people that have had x transmissions by k miles some with x transmissions  its the cars weak point for sure  engine has had class action lawsuit for sludgefailure  dealers still deny theres a problem  theyre told to be quiet about it  transmission class action is next  wd reliability is poor wd reliability is abysmal
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,lexus rx i put a lot of miles on my car for work the lexus is comfortable for long trips and isnt as bad on gas as the larger sport utilities the additional addons like sunroof six disc changer and heated leather seats just add to the enjoyment of driving this car

Lexus,Service/Maintenance,trans failure trans failed at miout of warranty had dealer replace trans ocos   maintenance schedule does not suggest or state to service trans by replacing trans oilfilter  just states to check fluid level will not purchase lexus or toyota againg
Lexus,Engine/Performance,luxury if you noticed the annual mileage portion of this review was left blank i couldnt comment as i have only had my rx for  months  of which ive been dealing with nothing but problems   days postwarranty my short block of the engine needed replacement as it was burning excessive oil lexus stood behind the motor but left me with the  labor bill dealership was horrible referring to me as a person looking to get an extra buck anyway i can telling me i didnt appreciate any of the work they had done and my list could go on will never deal with lexus or bergstrom ever again
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,rx  poor long term investment a nice car for the missus  she loves it size and drivability except for the horrendous small turning circle  lexus reliability on this vehicle is a myth  the same things go wrong every two years  there is nothing worse than intermittent problems that leave you stranded
Lexus,Price/Value,lexus update in the six years ive owned the rx  i can say the extra cost over a toyota was worth it i had my first maintenance problem a loose hose on the smog system due to bad roads kicking up debris the rx has survived a run through a rock slide with only a blown tire the other vehicles around me were totaled per the state police the vehicle is easy to drive and predictable to keep you out of   trouble i would definitely recommend this year model providing maintenance was done per schedule i will probably buy another lexus except i moved to a town with only a toyota dealer so i wiil  probably go with toyota thanks to all previous posters who convienced me to but a lexus hope this helps
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,rebadged highlander ive been driving it for about a year and the whole experience is boring to say the least theres little road information in the sluggish steering feel and road tracking isnt always linear and true braking is lousy and made artificially light what really irks me is a wide turning circle that hinders parking and no such things as back up sensors offered while cornering you really feel its weight i really feel this car is for a much older crowd this car offers a silenced cabin and wallowy ride yet unable to smooth out road bumps overall disappointing car considering its hefty price and bad fuel mileage
Lexus,Design/Style,wifes car she loves everything about it he think
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"hard to beat i needed an suv for work but wanted to drive a luxury car the rx does both extremely well smooth quiet perfection"
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,any older lexus may be tempting but dont do it bought my  rx for peanuts and thought it was a killer deal low miles dealer serviced but save yourself the headache and just dont do it  yes these are technically toyotas but the newest rxs are now over  years old they are a pita to work on mine just went into limp mode due to bad knock sensors and i just spent  for that parts were only  but it took ten hours of labor to change them drove it home and when i parked it it started idling at k rpm back to the shop it went ive now been without my lexus for two weeks fuel economy on my awd model is terrible and it has very little power its comfortable and safe but expect to spend alot on repairs
Lexus,Engine/Performance,very disappointed bought the lexus rx  because of lexus reputation of being a reliable vehicle sadly disappointed with our experiencewe bought this car  years ago with k miles on it and hoped to drive it over k miles unforunately at k miles the car had a steering column failure the worst the dealer had ever seen car was unsafe to drive cost of repairs  less than  months later at k miles the engine went expected cost to replace  for a used engine significantly more for a new onenever expected this from lexus at k miles are you kidding me should have read reviews before buying it
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,mobile money pit this is a terrible car i bought a lexus for the reliability but spent a fortune on repairs air compressor transmission would be the  biggies  check the lexus owner website about the complaints on this model i was lucky that the tranny went out at  my compressor went out at k transfer case died at k
Lexus,Design/Style,lexus never again the lexus rx is all about look and false reputation i bought this  rx k  months ago hopping to have a reliable vehicle at least for k based on toyotalexus false reputation and transmission blew at k then i saw on the web forums that is very common on rx transmissions blowing under k   or k lexus rx is a piece of crap overpriced to buy insane to fix next time i will definitely go with ford or chevy family i will recommend it to my worst enemy
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel, lexus rx  great suv  no major problems besides an oxygen sensor needing replacement acceleration is not great and fuel economy is not great either  fuel consumption got worse when i bought new tires  only dislike is that servicing is expensive and dealership cuts no breaks even for long time customer like me
Lexus,Design/Style,rx  paid cash for this beautiful car in the summer  years ago  i have since put so much money into repairs that i dont know what to do  ive put less than  miles on it in  years and spent thousands  first  o sensors two at once then electrical which no one but lexus will touch and will probably run me thousands at  an hour i suddenly had no control over heat radio   anything on the console  now as of today it is parked because of yet another problem  seems like horrible mix of gas  o sensors again  i cant even limp it to the dealer this time  second owner now i know why he got rid of it
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,rx  i bought this car less than  months ago and it seems to be very reliable however the gas mileage is terrible  mpg in the city and  mpg on the highway with fuel prices as high as they are we are considering selling it it is also very expensive to fix or get serviced i am one that likes to work on my own cars but with the lexus the majority of the parts you have to buy at the dealer at inflated prices i would think long and hard about buying this car unless you can afford the gas and services
Lexus,Engine/Performance, lexus rx nd owner of this  rx everything was fine until the auto trans went out at  miles with no warning lexus remanufact trans costs  this failure was very disappointing
Lexus,Price/Value,"lexus rx review my vehicle has not been as dependable as i thought a lexus would be however it is a quality vehicle but costly to keep maintained"
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,"overall good car nice car with small problems  driver side mirror crack first winter heated mirror too hot  driver side rear door wont shut after car wash in cold winter day  dealer tried to fix a few times but failed  i just avoid washing the car in cold winter day unless parked inside garage  fuel guage did not go up after fillup   computer chips replaced under warrenty"
Lexus,Engine/Performance, lexus rx this is a luxurious car that still has
Lexus,Price/Value,"expensive with problems i was so happy with my  es i got an rx for winters what a disappointment  within a year i had it in  times for the same problem  i never had service other than oil changes on the   it rattles alot  i just had my  maintenance and feel as though i got charged  an hour for labor when it looks no different and i have no proof for what was done"
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,bad battery  again nuerous problems with battery and
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"dont judge an rx by its cover the car looks and feels great but i am truly dissapoimted with lexus the laundry list of problems has me running from lexus from the now twice broken back hatch door shocks the dried out  cracked front window channels the needed lubrication of the back windows the bad idle control valve the noisy brake padsand this car only has k miles"
Lexus,Price/Value,paying a lot of money for a lot of issue dash squeak in the cold there is a coolant smell every once in a while and in the summer if you have the windows down there is a sulfur smell coming from the exhaust this is a nice car but with the amount of issues and the price i would never recommend it also i have noticed that lexus dealers are very quick to deny or just use the excuse that its not a big deal when they are approached with issues very disappointed in the car and in the way lexus deals with issues
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,to many problems  not enough answers already been to the shop  times rear view mirror vibrates too much heated seats are terrible i can leave them on in the summer and still not feel heat brake dust  dealer cant fix problems or admit these are problems lots of road noise navigation is terrible i get that its a sports ride but should it feel like i am driving in a  suv callers complain of quality when i use bluetooth
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,some minor quality control issues being my first lexus this  gs has spoiled me  im not sure i can shop for another manufacturer once my lease is up  but i have experienced some minor quality control issues that are annoying  within the first  months both side view mirrors gave out and required replacement occurred at different time the memory positions for the passenger front seat stopped working replaced a solenoid the sunroof wouldnt flip open replaced a solenoid and the motorized trunk would not secure replaced a mechanism within the motor  these have all been nuisance repairs but disappointing none the less mechanically the car is troublefree
Lexus,Engine/Performance,disappointed  should have gone for audi or mb bought a  cpo fsport   should have driven it longer than the  min test drive     very very disappointed i normally keep my cars  yearsthis one ive had  month and cannot wait to trade in for something elseshould have gone for an audi a or mb c   here is my viewpositives  looks nice fsport adds to the sporty look  quiet on highways and for sure will be extremely reliable having owned toyotas    negatives   acceleration is bad unless driven in sportssports plus mode which kills the gas mileageno torque at low speeds and the transmission seems to get stuck in higher gears too long kinda defeats the purpose of an speed tranny  seats are rock solid leatherno comfort at allmetallic gas paddlebrake look nice but very hard on feet handling is soso and harsh with the  inch wheelsno holder for sunglasses really   my toyota has it   no visor extender to block sun again my toyota has itcomplicated electronicstoo many menus to go thru for simple tasksand the mouse like controller is a painbottom line  overpriced for what you getcyl acceleration with cyl gas mileage    going to trade mine in soon while it is still under cpo warranty
Lexus,Engine/Performance,great big bones  poor technology package big bones performance   engine transmission handling is wonderful  technology package is horrible  totally unintuitive completely missed the mark  cant believe how little thought was put into very basic controls  disappointed is a complete understatement
Lexus,Design/Style,disappointed  i love the styling of my car and industry leading dealership experienceno one treats you betteri remain severely disappointed with the ipod interfaceits ugly when it works at all and totally unintuitiveive been in several k cars that do it way betterthe original yokohama tires fell apart at only k with the plies on two of them completely separating requiring all  to be replaced way sooner than they should have been
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,dont buy this car have has this car since  whenit first came outhad the old is  and an mhad no problems with either of these carsjust wanted another lexuswow what a shockthis car is the worst recallsbroken shockbad brakes both headlights went outfront driver seat contols went out and this is only at  milesthats very low milesvery nice design just very poorly madethen the camshaft needs work good thing under warrantythats  worth of workresale value very bad as wellplease reconsider when you think of buying this caris a lemon
Lexus,Engine/Performance,multiple problems first off i love the look of the car  however im very disappointed in the multiple problems ive had with it  its been in the dealer three times for the squeaky brakes  the first two they said that was the way they were manufactured because its a high performance car but the third time they said lexus came out with a new kit because of all the complaints  i just had the car in for a recall notice yesterday and they told me i needed rear brake pads theyre only  old and if i wanted the nonsqueaky pads it would cost  the dashboard noises are equally annoying and they fixed them two years ago but the noise just returned so back to the dealer i will go very frustrating
Lexus,Engine/Performance,reliability is artifically high while it has great performance the dealership and the lexus extended warranty are worthless  rattles that i say exist are either cant be duplicated or if found not covered under warranty have to pay for diagnostics  complained about a rattle when starting the car but dealership could not duplicate  this year voila  the rattle is a recall item which we received no notification but discovered when getting serviced at the dealer  reliability if they cant find it its not a problem  until the warranty runs out
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,bad tires bad rattles bad bad struts i changed the tires to a bridgestone with a  ration rather than a   with huge improvement in ride and noise  but the build quality isnt there  and rattles are getting bad at k miles  now have learned that rear shocksstruts need replacement  i am very very angry  finally the navigation system toyota makes is simply no good  maps ok but the lady inside has no sense of direction  im very surprised and disappointed at the reliability factor
Lexus,Design/Style,not up to lexus standards weve owned five lexus in my immediate family terrific build quality is their primary appeal the gs  awd in my experience is a flawed poorly built car  the front dash was removed and repaired with a kit to eliminate creaks and groans the front breaks howl and produce lots of black dust a kit will be available in jan  handling is no better than the es  i expected a reliable almost bmw car i have an unreliable not quite an es  four door sedan
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,not as bad as people say the only bad things i have seen that people say about the lexus gs  has to do with the inabililty to use the gps and bluetooth systems while driving   actually you can use them while driving if you utilize all the options the gs  offers you you only have limited use of the touch screen while driving but that is what the voice command is for you can use both the gps and the bluetooth to their full advantages if you understand how to use the voice command you can enter phone numbers and addresses via voice command while driving much easier and safer than pushing buttons while driving always read directions for your toys before saying they dont work
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,my two cents on the lexus gs  i have owned a lexus gs for almost a year now  overall it is very high quality and fun to drive  the car does have some drawbacks however  as some others have reported i had problems with an annoying rattle in the dash when it is cold outside and two trips to the dealer seem to have solved the problem  the other surprise was when i bought the car i discovered soon that it would not sync with my treo   now had to trade my phone for a motorola q which works but is a poor substitute as a phone  i thought bluetooth was bluetooth but would suggest a prospective buyer check the website for compatible phones before the purchase
Lexus,Design/Style,dash design flaw i buy a car every two years and this was my first lexus i have always bought bmw or mercedes but i thought i would give lexus a try  i loved the gs  awd design features and value for the money but was disappointed in the annoying dash board creaks and rattles the dealer had the car for two days to take the dashboard apart and install the felt package i drove off on a  degree day in boston grateful they had fixed it as soon as the temperature dropped below  degrees the dash creak returned rather than waste more time on dealer visits i sold the car i would not buy another lexus
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,navigation not very good this car performs and looks great however the nav system really stinks lexus decided there were functions that i shouldnt use when the car is moving ok i can then use the voice recognition system  no you cant that system cant recognize simple voice commands unless you are stopped and the fan is turned off  useless
Lexus,Price/Value,handler push hard there is flexibility in price benefit for multi car purchase loyalty program
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,lexus gs  no complaints other than lack of usb ports
Lexus,,lexus gs
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,getting lost it a bummer dont bother getting the navigation
Lexus,Price/Value,too many issues for the money dash squeak in the cold there is a coolant smell every once in a while and in the summer if you have the windows down there is a sulfur smell coming from the exhaust this is a nice car but with the amount of issues and the price i would never recommend it also i have noticed that lexus dealers are very quick to deny or just use the excuse that its not a big deal when they are approached with issues very disappointed in the car and in the way lexus deals with issues
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,mpg a big problem i have never checked the mpg on a car in  years of driving i complained to the dealer from day one and am still trying to get some help my average is about  mpg freeway or city streets got it up to  mpg on the road i have heard really stupid comments from lexus but i am concerned and if no other drivers have this problem guess it must be the car and a problem if other drivers cars do have the problem i would really like to know  miles at present on the car
Lexus,Engine/Performance,poor highway speed handling have complained about wandering at highway speeds  car requires continuous steering corrections  factory rep checked realigned and dealer has changed tire brands still the same  i dont trust lexus aka toyota to admit any problem especially since factory rep says he has never heard of any probs like this  he admitted he never reads lexus sites  relationship between electric steering wheeltire and suspension doesnt seem to be near as precise as my mbz clk but this car is as my wife describes jittery  i dont dare take my eyes of the road for a second  i might end up three feet into another lane or shoulder of the road have  miles on odo
Lexus,, lexus gs
Lexus,Engine/Performance,boring i had a new gs as a company carits veryuh nice i guessthe handling is mushy and imprecisethe drivetrain is about as responsive as a defensive tackleit has all the creature comforts you would expect from a lexushowever the stereo is lousy  whoever mark levinson is hes stealing money from lexus by getting paid to put his name on the premium sound systemall in all its a car that will make you feel older than you arei didnt realize how little fun it is to drive until i quit my job and bought an acura tl  now thats a drivers car
Lexus,Design/Style,dependable but front panel rattle issue while my lexus  gs  awd is very reliable i do have an issue with it the radio console and front dashboard panel on occasion will have rattling issues extremely annoying when the rattle starts i cant understand why lexus would put in a radio console that has multiple plastic part assembly in the radio panel and poor padding in the front dashboard panel very poor radioconsole design they missed this in there quality control ive brought my car in to the dealer twice theyve resolved most rattles in the front dashboard panel area but not the radio console front panel for a higher end luxury car this is unacceptable
Lexus,Price/Value,electronic issues i used to drive a lot for business problems started when the warranty expired it was like clock work first the cruise control went dead took it to the neighborhood lexus dealer they kept my car for a  hours and could not find the problem they were going to charge me   per hour for diagnostics naturally i didnt then the speedometer went crazy going back and forth to not working at all the car wouldnt shut off then nothing everything would work fine the next day the dealer told me its a sensor problem and would cost    to repair
Lexus,Engine/Performance,tire noise is horrible on our second set of tires and car has  miles on it  tire noise is driving us crazy  road noise inside car is worse than riding in my daughters honda civic  happens after about  miles on tires  dealer tells us its the high performance tires that are noisy  you would think a car of this value would drive quiet but thats not the case with the tires
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,never again i have had  lexus models ls  sc  gs  and most recently gs   have to say this is the last lexus i will ever drive  have had an annoying clunk in the front end when backing out of a parking spot  although everyone i have had in the car asks what the clunking sound is mysteriously it never occurs at the dealership  they have been unable to fix this ongoing problem  also tires had to be replaced at  kms approximately   tires are rated as all season  do not attempt to drive this car in snow conditions without snow tires   months left on lease cannot wait till end of term
Lexus,Price/Value, gs awd the car had two major flaws   low headroom   i am only  and my head almost scrapes the roof   the second flaw it the run flat tires   they do not take any abuse   they puncture easily and are very expensive   the dealer was not very clear about the option to put regular tires on the car
Lexus,Design/Style,body integrity is the issue the new gs   has plenty of technical features unfortunately this was my third lexus purchase but the worst the body integrity is very poor i had a mph accident and the car damages  the other car had a minor fender bend
Lexus,Engine/Performance,sporty and reliable my experience with this vechile has
Lexus,Price/Value,never had a problemnot even one switched from mercedes to lexus for the
Lexus,Design/Style,dont die before you drive a lexus  well you can spend all your life time driving other cars and your life goes on   or you can drive a lexus and every day you will be waiting for the moment you get in your lexus to drive home after work wow what a feeling being in a lexus after a long day at work on a heavy traffic day this is a meditation in a car and you will be wondering why other drivers around you are yelling and stressed because they dont drive a lexus look at any lexus drivers around you and you will see them just enjoying being united with their lexus its been stated multiple times that driving a lexus is therapeutic makes you wonder is it still a car try a  years old ls with k miles and you wont believe its a car bmw and mercedes must be worried seriously if you reading that review get yourself a lexus period
Lexus,Engine/Performance,lexusfinally mine this car has been a treasure to drive ive not had a bad time in it the only downside is i couldnt afford the  cylinder gs
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"a sure thing  safe bet i found that the car tends to get reallyboring really quickly  the steeringfeel is isolated from the road andacceleration is very poor at low speeds after about mph though the car hassome decent pickup    there is alot of lightweight material inthe dash the moonroof cover is looseand rattles at high speeds  there isalot more wind noise on the highway thani would have expected   for a blah  cylander engine fueleconomy on this car is prettydisappointing  especially for a toyotaproduct lastly with the standard issue tiresthis car is utterly useless in the rain im going to replace them soon"
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"reliabilty are you kidding me i bought this car instead of the mercedes i used to drive as a change of pace  my friends bragged about how great their lexus were  boy did they fool me  the cars electronics are bad bad bad  the stereo system cuts in and out the cd players skips and the sunroof leaks  my airbag lite is always on and my dealer cant fix it  i think they are tired of seeing me  the ride stinks this is not a performance car  the ride in this car is something my grandparents might enjoy  too mushy handles badly"
Lexus,,this is my nd lexus gs i leased gs in
Lexus,Design/Style,lexus gs bought the lexus after looking at
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"great summer car watch out for snow i love this car but with the winter weve had in the northeast its bad side has come out this is the worst bad weather car i have ever owned the traction control system is a joke im done with rear wheel drive cars"
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,"no traction and exploding tires tires goodyear known to blow outand did on me  rear drivepoor traction pulling out on wet pavement and no traction on even a little snow  nice car but poor gas mileage and transmission bucks every once in a while"
Lexus,Engine/Performance,lexus not a real sporty car
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,bought  gs in  i have never bought a  year old car beforebut it was roomy for my  frame and  lbsi found a  owner car fax certified model with  milesbeside routine maintenance i had work down on memory front seat and upper and lower control arms in the front  i have not regretted buying it
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,wishing id never purchased it i purchased this car and prior to close had to force them to give me new tires as my certified vehicle tires were badly worn  nicks chips in excess of what one would expect for a car with k miles  within a few months the radio numbers were barely visible  minor repairs still covered by warranty were required now at k i would have spent k fixing items but for the fact that i deferred a  service that would be a nice to have and the dealer will pay for the labor on a power steering column i have to replace after doing a  service two weeks ago  i should have kept es k miles without the problems im having here at k terrible snow handling
Lexus,Design/Style,gs in georgia the gs caught my attention due to
Lexus,Price/Value,perfecto buy it immediately
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,"i want my bmw  series back my gs has been in the shop  times sounds like a friggin alian spaceship landing in the fr at  lexus says its normal but they cant reproduce on another car replaced the rack tires  other parts with no results slight presure on the brakes  the noise goes away but they wont replace the caliper  too logical maybe first mo they said absolutly theres a problem now they claim its fixed  its normal noise also the car wanders horribly on the highway thats why they replaced the rack  no change they took the front end out of spec  did help the drift but its still miserable a bit of wind on the road pushes me around bummer huh"
Lexus,Price/Value,"lots of power i bought my car in september of  and i love it but it is almost impossible to drive in the snow  there is a traction control button but it is basically worthless when you drive over  mph  i will probably sell it before next winter but for those of you who have the fotune not to deal with snow i highly recommend this car"
Lexus,Design/Style,gs  w gps i am a realtor and gps saves time and
Lexus,Engine/Performance,oh my god i just purchased a gs sport edition
Lexus,Engine/Performance,a love hate relationship bought it new and have had a love hate relationship since  overall quality is very good but performance stinks  sporadic shifting pattern especially after slowing and making  degree turn then accelerating again will drive you nuts  also shifting pattern in stop and go urban traffic will drive you even nuttier  computer and esc dont have a clue how to respond  recallupgrade of esc was done in  but really didnt fix the problem  dealer acknowledges this as an engineering problem typical to the car  big unforgivable mistake for a car in this price range
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,bad choice i was excited when first buying this car but then it was all downhill from there the interior lack any bit of luxury the seats are hard and uncomfortable especially with lumbar on my kids absolutely hate the back seat beacuse there is little to no room in the back even with the front seats forward another thing one sunny afternoon i couldnt get the car to start and i had to try three times to get it started i say sunny because most of the time the car wont start when it is cold or wintery weather but this weather was fine i have no idea why also many things inside the car are not as tight as they should be when i bought the car the front passenger seat pocket was stretched
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,"shake rattle and roll i bought my gs  new in  from the beginning the little irritations have driven me crazy there is a shimmy and shake somewhere in the rear seat that comes and goes when the wheels are properly alligned the steering wheel shakes there are other annoying rattles in the front dash somewhere i finally gave up bringing these annoyances to the dealers attention as they have been unable to find or fix them  i do love the gps feature and gas mileage around town of  mph is reasonable the seats are comfortable and the ride is fairly smooth the car is not as quiet as i was expecting"
Lexus,Design/Style,whats not to like bought my gs used in  after years
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,"lexus  years and running overall good car had to replace battery at miles and the front caliper at mileshad the front seat rediedat they were looking kinda wornthe transmission kinda acts weird onthese models when they are cold buthave had no problems with it i have hadit in on all factory visits and thedealership has done the work"
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,return trip on business i drove my business partners  gs
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,nothing to complain about i have had this car for a little over
Lexus,Engine/Performance,problems  mos in service at k miles ac clutch and hub replaced power steering unit replaced steering shaft u bolt replaced to stop grinding sound with tires rotated and checked for wear the goodyears became noisy  k miles and wore unevenly tire rep said they usually give k miles service replacements are expensive as performance tires are mandatory new michelins are doing just fine numerous rattles were finally fixed after many miles of aggravation key areas failed not the toys limited number of dealerships is a minus
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,dont buy lexus  i owned  rx for  years now pies of crap i had a bmw that i trade for lexus and that was the biggest mistake in my life transmission is crap stereo system broke doesnt read cds getting error  and  when then something is knocking inside the dashboard pretty loud behind the stereo you take your lexus to the dealer services and tell them whats wrong they dont want to do anything just tells you that thats the way its should be but its really not never get lexus again
Lexus,Engine/Performance,my lexus my wife and i purchased this vehicle for her and since i must drive it periodically i feel free to comment on it i am somewhat disappointed with the performance and handling aspects of this vehicle it handles almost as badly as my isuzu and no where near as well as my benz the transmission and the parts cost are my single major complaints as well as the service intervals which for a vehicle of this so called caliber should be less frequent the transmission really feels like an old yugo with a stick too much jerky and choppy i would not purchase another lexus until they could assure me that this and the maintenance intervals are more rational
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,bad model bought the  lexus because i drove the rx  and loved it yet this car has disappointed the transmission lags horribly going from a stop you press on the gas with no response and then a huge lurch forward we took it into the dealer and explained the problem and they insisted nothing was wrong and it was how they all run only to talk to them  years later and they admit that this car was underpowered however the styling space and comfort was exceptional
Lexus,Price/Value,lovehate relationship with my rx  on the highway the rx  drives like a dream but intown driving is a different story the transmission is terrible when shifting from first to second gear too much hesitation the headlights have a blind spot in curves i expected more at this price point
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,lexus blew it with the rx  this vehicle is a huge disappointment we had an  rx  that was perfect  this vehicle has horrible wind noise  the seat heater switches are hard to use and poor quality  the tires are worn out with less than  miles  i recently drove it to oklahoma  miles one way and the seats were extremely uncomfortable  my passenger told me they would never ride in the lexus again  the rear windshield wiper is lousy
Lexus,Engine/Performance,warning problem with rotors the rotors had to replaced at l miles after the steering wheel began to shake at  miles i was driving down a  mile  grade in third gear and needed to brake because the traffic slowed the steering wheel suddenly shook so badly that i had to pull over and let the rotors cool before proceeding rotors were replaced for a second time if you have paint chip on the bumper do not take the rx through a high pressure car wash as the paint may peel off the bumper as it did in my case lexus will do nothing about it is your problem even if the car is within warrentee i feel the vehicle is unsafe because of the rotor problem i would not suggest buying one
Lexus,Engine/Performance,the rx  has no clothes seats do not compare to our porsche or saab tilt function is simply inflation of seats leading edge arm rest way too short to be useful major fatigue on long trips never really get adjusted  lines of sight to check for vehicles in prep for lane change are awful again comparison is to saab and porsche  throttle response delay is shameful and dangerous toyota excuses it as computer seeking correct response  lame no road feel  wind noise and engine noise unacceptable for lexus  had an ls  that was whisper quiet it was great in all respects  this  is not great in any respect  below average in many  sorry we bought it within a month of purchase date
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,unbelievable lemon lexus i purchased the lexus for mechanical reliability unfortunately in the first week the gas tank had to be reattached because it was not bolted properly shortly after that the power steering pump had to be replaced the radio stopped playing the amplifier had to be replaced the ignition system chimed after i removed the key had to be replaced then the radiator was recalled and had to be replaced the transmission seemed confused at times when acceleratingi asked for a replacement car after the first incident in the first weeklexus customer service said it was all covered under warranty and offered an extended warranty  mo later i would not pay the extra money for a lexus again
Lexus,Engine/Performance, month review plenty of power and acceleration rides
Lexus,Engine/Performance,its a lexus lemon nothing but issues with the transmission slipjerksjumps my biggest complaint is that my lexus rx  doesnt no what gear to use now it started to make that whinning noise my lexus only has  miles and its done i am more that unhappy with lexus so much money for a lemon yes its been pampered all of its life and still give me problems lexus never again
Lexus,Price/Value,total dog this car has been a dog since the day i got it  years agofrom the beginning the car refused to accelerategive it time to learn your driving habits the dealership told merightit has made an awful grating metallic noise every  starts or so right from the beginningdealership has been unable to diagnose whyfinally a brake sensor has broken  times at a cost to replace of  each timethis on a car with k miles i make it my mission to make sure no one i know ever buys a lexuswhat a disgrace
Lexus,Design/Style,lexus rx  have had too many repairs  radiator crankshaft pulley noise around the air conditioner line all had to be repaired  i thought a lexus would run forever with no problems if properly maintained  very disappointed in this  visibility is somewhat limited because of design  disappointed and thinking about looking for something else  i thought this would be a car to last me  years
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,soooo disappointed this was the wrong choice for me driving the rx  for approximately two weeks i am so very frustrated it is so uncomfortable for anyone over  to drive i am  the seat cushions are too short  gives no support under my knees i have to move my seat back to stretch my legs out to be comfortable and not be on top of the gas pedal the whole time restraining my foot from laying too heavily on the gas doing so then i have to drive with my arms outstretched in an awkward uncomfortable manner because the steering wheel does not telescope out far enough told my hubby to hurry and get rid of it i will opt for an  ls  instead now and the  rx  in four years at a used car price
Lexus,Engine/Performance,overrated this car is overrated we got it loaded and that was a big mistake all of the extra technology features such as the bluetooth the nav voice recognition and the dvd are all total junk the bluetooth sounds terrible and is unusable the voice recognition does not function the nav is nearly impossible to operatemy  garmin is better the ac is not nearly strong enough for the weather in austin which is actually not that hot compared to other parts of the south
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,disappointed driver typical toyota high build quality and reliability but feels soulless on the road  front seat passengers seem to enjoy the vehicle more than i do  rear seat passengers aside from the low seat also seem pleased  but behind the wheel the steering is dull the transmissiondrivetrain seems to hesitate before doing your bidding  normally disappointment in the driving department is made up at the gas pump but not here where i see  mpg in the city and  on the highway  oh well at least with the lexus name and good resale value i can probably get out of this vehicle for not much less than what i paid for it preowned
Lexus,Engine/Performance,poor performance  we bought this brand new and kept it only  months  in buying it my wife did not understand her desire for a car that actually went when you pressed the gas  after trying to get constant hesitations programmed out of the controller for our car we gave up and sold this nice but totally poor performance car for a bmw x which blows the lexus away
Lexus,Price/Value,disappointed lots of rattles the brake pedal makes a constant irritating thumping noise everytime i even tap it    windshield wipers get frozen to the windshield and rip off and inevitably scratch the windshield before ive had a chance to replace them  a heated windshield would be appropriate the most astounding thing that shocked me was that i had to purchase  expensive snow tires for this awd suv  the all season that came with the sale of the vehicle did not perform at all in the snow  i was literally sliding all over the road and had no choice but to spend  to buy snow blizzaks
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,my lexus this has been a good car however i am disappointed in a few things i am very surprised a car this nice came without heated seatsthe stereo cd systems has aready had to be repaired  times and the locking system stinks i can not unlock all the doors at the same time i have been told this can not be fixed it makes it hard since a have a child in a car seat in the back
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,i wanted so badly to like it so im a current lexus owner love the brand and have been waiting months for the rxl to come out and replace our family vehicle with a  row suv  i was so excited when the rxl came out and i went to the dealership with checkbook in hand ready to buy  i literally cannot understand what lexus was thinking with the rd row design  i expect midsize suv rd rows to be childsized but this was completely nonfunctional and worse than any ive ever seen  with the nd row seats in the back position the back of the nd row seat touches the bench of the rd row with precisely zero leg space  it touches  with the second row seats in the farthest forward position i or my teenage kids still could not lock the second row seat in place in its farthest forward position because the knees of the rd row passenger were in the way  it was physically impossible  the fact that the car is only  inches longer than the  row version should have been my first clue  if you need to get any child older than about  or a dog which is exactly what they show in the new rxl commercial the rd row is physically impossible to use  not just cramped not just tight both of which i expected  literally physically impossible to use and completely worthless  it was such a disappointment  we ended up buying the highest optioned toyota highlander awd hybrid limited platinum instead  not quite a lexus but darn darn close and a bit cheaper too  i was so excited waiting for the rxl but its a complete whiff with regard to the rd row which is what we were holding out for  i still love the two row version the rx is still a great vehicle but the rxl turned out to be completely pointless
Lexus,Price/Value,hard to beat bought this car from my son who put over k miles in less than  months  read editors model review which a lot better than consumers ratings  had a minor problem with tire warning coming on and not a very smooth ride the dealer techs kept replacing the sensor in the tires and the warning would stay off for a couple thousand miles and i would have to go back in again well to make a long story short the front struts were bad  although out of warranty lexus replaced them and now it handles like a k car again i own a small auto repair shop and you will not go wrong buying this car for around k
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,ml to gs i bought this case because everything
Lexus,Engine/Performance,the mad lexus as tame and humble as it may seem this beast hungers for excitement its hard to be a consertive driver in this quite machine handling ride and upmost performance doesnt capture the far reaching words needed to describe the experance of the gs it wants to go and i do let it loose on occasion
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,sweetness i have just recently purchased this
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,"must get another car for winter if you are seduced to buy gs be prepared to buy another car for the winter this one does not run even in  in of snow traction control is worthless i have gs  mercedes bmw drive up my driveway  days after a snow fall but my gs  got stuck repeatedly worse dealership experience in my  years of driving absolutely unwilling to help be warned be very warned"
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel, gs  a well built car that is not being
Lexus,Design/Style,silver  gs i bought this car used and i must say
Lexus,Engine/Performance,mountain gem lexus continues to impress with outstanding quality and luxury performance the land cruiser base is solid as ever and delivers rugged reliability topped off with lexus comfort
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,instant repeat after five years of owning a  lx  i was told it was time for a new car the problem was after test driving other suv model cars there was no comparison  the pick up was the biggest difference  there is not another suv of this size with the pick up and reliablity of pick up as the lx  there is not a smoother suv on the road  i bought the identical car and i would do it again  the only complaints are the same as they were in   the third row seats are too difficult to operate and move in and out  the tail gate should also swivel out as in the smaller  model  i have to get into the car to remove groceries  id also like another  split between the the back two seats
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,whats a car without service bought  may by end of may went
Lexus,Design/Style,"lexus lx i have only one negative comment  and that is the way the rear gate opens  it opens like a door instad of like a gate  when putting groceries in the back i like to have the gate serve as a cover for me in the rain while i load groceries  im not a fan of the way this back gate is designed"
Lexus,,eeeeeeexxxxxxxcellant a periodeverything about this
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,lexus screen for navigation system failed
Lexus,Design/Style,the past in the present the lx is a throwback in automotive
Lexus,,lexus lx  exceeded our expectations  our rd
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,lexus experience this is my rd lx and i drive
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,what a suv i switch to a lexus from mercedes  i
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,my  lexus lx  i am on the road a lot and carry  lbs in the back i have just turned  miles and my only expense beside maintenance was a wheel bearing i could never say this about any other car i have driven
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,problems  what problems i have not had a single problem with
Lexus,Price/Value,"my nd is better than the st i have owned bt far beats the competition hands downno issues with performanceunmatched off roadand the quality is paramount to any vehicle i have ever owned  they retain value and that is almost impossible with a car but not with the lx or any lexus for that matter"
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,luxuryqualityperformancefun lexus continues to improve upon
Lexus,Design/Style,king suv i just bought this car may   and
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel, miles no problems yet the only thing about this car i dont like about this car is the mpg i get around  however that is after  years and  miles
Lexus,Price/Value,passionate pursuit of imperfection had this suv for a long time now and the quality of the vehicle is terrible too many issues and too many costly repairs i have under k miles on thisissues cd disks get stuck in the player  ignition went out and it cost me  nondealership to fix it i was told that lexus placed the starter in such a position that it takes a min of  hrs to replace a similar replacement on american cars take less than hr the antenna doesnt go down didnt fix this shock are leaking oil and needed replacement  recently the ignition switch actually broken when turning the key what a crappy engineering using cheap metals  the dealer says it is normal
Lexus,Price/Value,suspension system purchased new in april of  i drive this lexus very little has been garaged all its life now has  miles at  suspension went outcost to repair   in  now after  miles suspension went out again feb service department says this is going to happen about every five  years no matter how few miles it has been driven  cost to repair now  it looks brand new inside and out but now rides like a gravel truck this will be my last lexus
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,this is not a suv its a luxury car iv owned a range rover  i thought
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,die i have owned  vehicles in my life
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,this review for   still has bugs i had a  lx with several
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"not quite worth the money its far to large no reason for it to be made horrible fuel mielage not great looking high price for not such a great vehicle horrible engine much to slow no power at all"
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,not worth the money purchased as nd owner with  miles havehad it since  now has  miles on itthe moulding on doors was replaced twice because of wind noise still noisyradio badcd quite working about  year ago went to cassette and now it dosent work and the antenna failed all with less than  easy miles on itour upkeep is around  every  months the leather interior is cracking and is going to cost about  to replaceworst car for the money spent that i have ever hadwe have a  honda accord with  miles that i drive
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,classy bought this vehicle used from repeat owner of lx s who also loves the lx  we have driven it in the rocky mountains and northern michigan in various extreme weather and road conditions and it hardly skipped a heartbeat then the problems front wheel portion of awd failed completely without warning and complete and thorough maintenance  records upkeep no reason just failed with less than k miles on vehicle lexus company left me dry and lacking enthusiasm for its continued reliability stating i should have bought extended warranty chagrined that a seemingly top notch vehicle of this caliber has such a major problem with so few miles but goes to show failure happens
Lexus,Design/Style,lx one of the most reliable vehicles ive ever owned the fact that the body style hasnt changed in a while it makes it almost impossible to tell the model year
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,new lexus lease theres some road noise that enters the car cabin wind noise isnt notice the biggest complaint is the entertainment system theres a large learning curve it took me a week to get know the system im not able to give a complete review because i only had the car for two weeks
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,dream car disaster lexus ls hl i have been a loyal lexus customer for  years i ordered my dream  lexus ls  hl  it was shipped from japan i specifically requested the executive pkg to my dismay after a  week wait genevieve riehl of bergstrom lexus ordered me the wrong car  i was incensed but never forgot about the car i wanted so on  i bought the car from west palm beach fl i had some problems with the salesman but nothing close to what transpired after a road trip  weeks ago i put less than k per year miles on my car but decided to drive it to wi it broke down on the hwy  miles out i waited  hrs for lexus roadside assistance they never showed a cop boosted this flagpole
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,reliable lexus
Lexus,Design/Style,mover v moves out
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"bad in snow i was very disappointed with the performance of the gs after our recent snow fall of   the car was loose even is the snow traction feature  it over all is poor in any slick conditions"
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,pursuit of perfection really i purchased a my gs with k on it and documented service history at the dealer all the way back to and including the window sticker i am now at k and the plastic case around the ac evaporator has failing adhesive that leaks water into the car  repair  the starter takes about  min to actually start   repair and it will be due for the  k maintenance at the next oil change thats  in maintenance before k miles this is not the type of quality i expect from toyota or lexus  i dont think i will buy another and i would give some serious thought to repair expenses before i purchased one of their products  the headliner and sunroof sunshade have had rattles also
Lexus,Price/Value,so disappointed coming from an mb i had an ml still do w over k miles that has been very capable so i though this lexus would be even better with the existing notion of reliability of japanese cars unfortunately this car has been disappointing the transmission jerks between lower gears  especially it has a horrible rattling noise from the underbody took to several places and noone can fix it it is very basic for the price i paid no bluetooth nav or even backup camera poor tractionstability control in the michigan snow
Lexus,Engine/Performance,funky shifting when turning to the right i have owned  lexusslexi before buying my wife a  rx loved a  rx  gx was blah the  rx was the worst of the bunch boring driving not refined at all nothing special about it it had a soft supension and steering that rolled in the corners the major problem i had was with the shifting when you would turn to the right from a stop it would take  seconds to engage after you turned besides annoying it was dangerous when taken to the dealer they said it was normal i traded that off for an escalade the next day after owning a cadillac srx my wife wants to buy another lexus so we have been looking at them again  and it seems there have been a few complaints about tranny issues with the older lexus i have owned five lexi and after owning several cadillacs lately i am ready to get back to a more reliable vehicle although the problem with the  kept me away from lexus for  years
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,lexus rx   i bought this car at lexus of las vegas  original owner  the vehicle drive smooth but the tranmision nd  rd jerking really bad i bring it back to the dealer they tell me tranmision went out estimated  to replace at  miles the tranny give up that is not reliable  according to service man he see a lot tramision problem some are neweri have  boys i drive like an old man i never thought this could happened very disappointed
Lexus,Design/Style,poor design horrible resale value purchased the fwd  rx in nov  with  miles it was certified pre owned i like all the bells and whistles that it came with such as the telescoping steering wheel and leather seats just to name a few i drove it from sc to tx and the drive was excellent nice and quiet i do not like the front design it looks too feminine and also the so claimed re sale value is terrible i tried to trade it in and was sadly informed that i would be k upside down if i traded it in with miles in excellent condition although it is a nice vehicle it does not hold its value
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,last lexus a lemon rather than detail all my lexus woes which the dealership has tried and sometimes succeeded in fixing i can just say that this  rx is the noisiest car i have had  there is a persistent rattle in the rear passenger window that looks like it is caused by a faulty window assembly  the bumper rattles when turning  the car has been through a bit  as a car in nyc is wont to be  but the quality problems have been very disappointing for a car with a stellar reputation
Lexus,Design/Style,gold standard of suvs i am on the road a lot and appreciate how quiet this vehicle really is the cabin is so quiet i actually look forward to talking on the cell phone over the cars blue tooth  i have owned hondas and toyotas in the past so appreciate the level of build quality that went into the rx i have near k and not one single problem i average around  in the city  on the highway in summary lexus rx  is the gold standard of suvs
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,a lexus to forget i purchased my rx in oct i traded in a  bmw what a huge mistake the car has many quality defects and is sub standard in all categories the tires were out of balance electrical problems road noise wind noisefit and finish problems the base audio system is poor the factory nav system came with the old version of software for k this car is over priced over rated and just a lexus to forget it is in the class of a buick or cadillac not bmw or mbdo not purchase one i will be trading for a bmw or a benz in the spring
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,not for me all i can say is so far so bad no fun at all to drive cant even feel the road armrest is worthless because it is too short to rest your arm on it vibrations and rattles that are very annoying disabling navigation and bluetooth features while moving renders options i paid for useless center console poorly designed
Lexus,Price/Value,disappointed in louisiana i traded in my  runner for this car two weeks ago and i am so disappointed  i thought i was buying a luxury suv but that was not the case  there is way more road noise than i expected  i dont know if this is due to the tires or a lack of cabin insulation  the ride is average definitely not luxurious and do not plan on seating more than four adults comfortably  also the radio is terrible for a car in this price range  it crackles already at medium volume  i miss my runner
Lexus,Price/Value,bad resale valie the resale value when leasing this vehicle is terrible
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,well built  comfortable but awful tech this is a well built and comfortable car however the technology while outstandingly marketed is absolute crap voice recognition is extremely inaccurate complex and distracting to use it is so bad i have almost completely abandoned it my  year old garmin portable gps has better voice recognition and routing features but their is no safe or interfering place to mount it or i would be using it emails and phone calls to lexus  toyota have been useless poor dealer support for tech issues multiple dealers map upgrades are infrequent extremely expensive  must be done by dealer keeping other technology current is also very expensive the ability to enter in addresses from a computer was a marketing feature but so complex and buggy that it made it time consuming and frustrating for the user subsequently that feature has been removed leaving  address entry options to be a joystick on the screen keyboard or a complex entry procedure transfer procedure from a smartphone the screen supported interface is very user unfriendly and is only controlled via joystick this includes entertainment selection and good air management live assistance extra cost is often problematic some controls are difficult to access when driving some others are unneeded duplicates that adds confusion windshield has some builtin technology and likely very expensive to replace options were outrageously overpriced ie headsup display from dealer was  but high quality from rd party was  rear camera is affected by rain tailgate has enough force to knock you over before stopping if it hits you tech that works well includes park assist not automatic blind spot sensing and adaptive cruise control interior lighting is poor car is comfortable and runs well and has a lot of unneeded frosting that boosts the pricing good cargo space gas mileage is poor in summary i do not recommend this car due to poor technology low gas mileage and poor customer support based on this experience i currently have absolutely no interest in purchasing a lexus or toyota product again lexus marketed this vehicle as including advanced technology in reality it is anything but in my opinion attempting to use many to the technology features while driving makes this car unsafe to drive in retrospect i should have invoked the california lemon lawupdatevoice recognition vr is so bad and frustrating to use i have completely given up using it there have been no navigation updates for this vehicle since fall or  traffic alerts are incorrect at least half the time in order to relieve myself of this stress i plan to get rid of this vehicle buy june  to avoid double registration fees for  the sad truth of all of this is that in all of the vehicles i have tested so far none have vr that is as good or better than my  garmin  as such i am focused on purchasing my next vehicle without in dash navigation or voice recognition but to use my garmin instead this issue is that all the manufactures i have explored link safety features to in dash navigationvr the only suv manufacture i have found so far that does not link in dash tech to critical safety features and has a spot for my garmin is the  lexus rx so ultimately might have to bite my tongue and buy another lexus however i am still doing research on this to avoid purchasing another lexus if that is possible
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,th time round i have owned other makes of cars but i keep coming back to lexus because of the dependable quality and the luxurious interior
Lexus,Engine/Performance,luxury performance and ride
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,nice car but needed major repair we bought our rx  in september of   we also have a  lexus rx  that we love after owning the rx  for only  months we noticed an oil leak under the car we took it to the dealer and it was an oil leak from the timing chain cover  very disappointed with this   the dealer said it would take at least a week to repair it we never had any major problems with our  rx
Lexus,Engine/Performance,"who allowed this electronics interface to be released over my driving life ive owned more than  cars of many different makes and models ive spent my  year career in technology i enjoy cars and i love tech and am tech savvy  this car by far has the absolute worst electronics interface ive ever seen i had read it was bad but with my experience thought how bad can it really be well its awful im frankly dumbfounded  toyota is known for being overly intrusive  nannyish but this is absurd there arent preset buttons to change the station just steering wheel controls it always want to show the map and overlay other info but only for a little while in short it kind of ruins what is otherwise a really great car"
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,very disappointed  very hard ride when you hit bumps you get jolted
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,satellite radio problems disappointed i bought a  lexus rx this june replacing my  rx immediately noticed that reception of the satellite radio is constantly being interrupted i have had sirius radio for  years now i am driving down the same streets and have never before had any service interruptions lexus has told me they cannot do anything about it local dealer has told me it is a problem with all   struly affects the enjoyment of my driving experience
Lexus,Price/Value,i am a one owner of a  lexus suv this suv is  the smoothest vehicle i have ever owned
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,my rx   cent i ma not sure about the fuel consumption
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,wish i didnt buy a lexus  rx  loaded  traded down from a bmw x  with  miles  i thought buying a lexus would be a good choice since my bmw had a ton of miles on it and the lexus was much cheaper  the saying is true you get what you pay for  ive owned the lexus for  weeks  times in the shop  first a mirror then the bluetooth x and then the drivers seat  i weigh about  lbs so its not me  this car is slow and sloppy  i will be trading it in as soon as get a little equity built up  very disappointed
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,disappointment very poor riding vehicle on long drives  just did a  mile trip from fl to boston  was torture  could not wait to get out of car at end of day  most all on route  so very few poor roads  all tar strips and road imperfections transferred into seat pan  seats very pretty but not supportive enough seats are for small people  seat pan not large enough  i am a little over the size of average person  good for errands and short trips would not buy another one  good gas mileage  will sell in less than a year
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,lexus rx  i bought a brand new rx  and this car has had more problems then any other car i have had including used cars shocks mad noise at  miles and battery leaks and water pump at  miles
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,horrible gas mileage dont believe the mpg claims after  miles mine hovers around   lexus advertises  highway city  combined this is fraudulent
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,the gold standard theres a reason other automakers of suvs compare themselves to the lexus rx  its darned hard to beat  last fall we went looking for the one vehicle that could give us everything we already had in two  a lexus  ls and a nissan murano  the rx had all the comfort quiet and dependability of the ls and charged through snow as well or better than the murano  complaints  just a couple  it costs more than it should the extended sunroof hardly opens a crack  and the voice commands are pathetic  ask for play msnbc and you might hear sing my country tis of thee  the select a year button wasnt working it was
Lexus,Engine/Performance,a let down bad transmission hesitation issue at low speeds engine whining and droning slow from the start no power uphill no luxury feel to it in city driving
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,viberation sucks  i got  rx last november everything is good but the vibration is very bad inside cabin and from the seat i have to deattach my back from the seat for reduce the uncomfortable feelings the suspension is too soft a little bump on the road will cause it to shake a bit most of the time it is like on a boat on the water dont like it it is a good looking car but no a pleasant ride we regreat didnt ride it carfully when we buy it the sales man said every car is the same so we just looked the color after test ride a demol car thinking about to trade it in next year     mg
Lexus,Price/Value,car starter not standard with my  lexus i really love my  fsport lexus suv but i think it is a shame that a vehicle this expensive does come equipped with standard remote starter using the key fob i have to pay lexus enform to use remote start with the key fob and if i want to start my vehicle using the phone app
Lexus,Service/Maintenance, rx  cruise control transmission problems cruise control is extremely jerky and hard on drive train when going uphill and over the crest of the hill and traveling down hill the transmission constantly shifts up and down with a extremely jerky movements lexus dealer claims everything operating  within specs  lexus rx
Lexus,Engine/Performance,to costly the cost of new or certified preowned lexus is outrageous  i would go for a cadillac xr for the value except gm products the past  years have been poor in workmanship quality and performance  i have friends who own and a mechanic and this is thier recommendations
Lexus,Engine/Performance,in the same boat wish i had read these reviews before i purchased  same story with me traded in  because of shifting issues for a  took bid hit in the depreciation only to find the  is even worse major vibration  taking it in for the second time only  miles on it so well see what they say  after reading others it looks like ill be taking another hit in the wallet because the car is not drivable in its current condition  so if youre thinking of this vehicle do not buy  especially if lexus is blowing it off
Lexus,Engine/Performance,trust is completely broken on lexus brand this was my first lexus with some positive expectations based upon the reputation it has carried for decades  after one year the whole family has concluded that the car was actually not good  i drive  cars concurrently and have experience most foreign cars including german luxury ones japanese luxury brands and many korean brands  i would say this is the worst experience i had  performance is bad  horse power is not enough handling is rough  surprisingly pretty noisy car  comfort  i dont know what today i just feel more tired when i drive this car compared to all of my cars mercedes bmw honda acura hyundai kia even proche etc
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,lexus please fix drone noise and vibration issue good sharp design and nice looking inside and out quality interior materials no squeaking noises roomy interior luxury feel good base stereo bad second year in production and common issue with annoying drone noise  vibration still not fixed hard to believe transition is set for maximum mpg and hardly forcing higher gears  lower rpms causing drone noise and vibration coming from inadequately designed exhaust system while slow incline on higher gearlower rpms dealer said it is normal characteristic of the new rxs  and  are affected no fix until now end of january  illogical entertainment system very confusing to navigate not intuitive at all no manual onoff controls for ac slow throttle respond slow acceleration slow rear gate heavy doors voice recognition does not understand me most of the time too soft powersteering feels like a driver has no  control too soft suspension my is wd not fsport model feels unstable in curves transition shifting is strange sometimes is not sure what gear should choose definitely not what i expected form lexus and   our other cars  outback  is quiet and smooth like years ago while dealer delivery and absolutely outstanding  fpace diesel  pleasure and fun to drive with no single issue if you just need a machine to move you from point a to b than rx is for you but if you are car person and having enjoyment while drivinglook elsewhere
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,probably my last lexus been a lexus owner since  this one measure up in so many ways but the noise drone and vibration though the pedals steering wheel and center console are terrible lexus tells me thats the nature of this model my chevy truck is a dream to drive compared to this one
Lexus,Engine/Performance,disappointment in flawed lexus there is a known issue with my  rx  it sounds and feels like a transmission issue but have been told it is an issue with the exhaust system  they know and have know for a long time there is a problem and do not yet have a fix for it  i have been complaining for a year now  initially was told it was my imagination  but since then was told it is a known issue   still waiting   it is loud and sounds and feels like the engine is not wanting to shift to higher gears  this is my third lexus as i had found them to be so reliable  now not so sure  mpg for city is running about  mpg should be much higher
Lexus,Price/Value,terrible for a lexus  cant wait to sell it i was coming out of an acura mdx into the lexus rx  fsport  i am very disappointed in the vehicle and with lexus   the cars with headsup display come with a windshield that causes headlights and streetlights to be duplicated like being cross eyed after taking pictures and getting a lexus service tech to ride in the car in darker weather they agreed there was a problem  at first lexus corporate said it was defective glass and replaced the windshield when the problem still existed they found an engineer that knew that there was different glass for cars with hud their solution was to put the glass from nonhud equipped vehicles into my car this glass then made the hud blurry and duplicated and rendered it useless i eventually got my money back for the hud since its now useless  during this experience i found that using polarized glasses eliminated the problem i shared with lexus dealer and corporate and received the response we trust our engineers to solve the problem so i found a solution that costs about   a clear polarized window film would solve the problem instead they want to break the factory seal on the windshield and put in a  windshield rendering the hud useless   i have less than k miles on the car and have rattles in the drivers door and the roof  of course the dealer cannot reproduce the issue   rear hatch struts werent lubricated correctly and squeal loudly  entertainment software usability is very poor and not intuitive it doesnt remember your last media setting and turns off when using bluetooth connections  mouse is too sensitive and creates a safety issue to use when driving even after adjustment  the overall fit and finish of the car feels cheap when shutting doors it sounds like hollow metal slamming  ive had lower end cars that dont sound like that   no remote start without a paid subscription for a  luxury car how can this not be a standard feature     the mark levinson stereo is definitely not worth the money it is not surround sound not tuned to be balanced for different music types and sounds like the rear speakers dont work  the base stereo sounded better    there are some nice features on this car but it is significantly lacking overall quality in many areas putting it below low end car makers like kia and hyundai  the biggest issue is how ive been treated by corporate lexus when dealing with the hud windshield issue but combined with everything else this car is a huge waste of money
Lexus,Design/Style,not a pretty face  i do not like the looks of the grill  but you can not see it from the driving seats
Lexus,Price/Value,over committed under delivered have only had the rx for  weeks  ride is smooth handling is good overall a good car but not great the packages are hokey  the hands free tail gate which is on almost every car has worked once  try to use it and im out there waving my hand over the sensor looking like an idiot and then need to open it conventionally  this wouldnt bother me except they charge  for this worthless option and it is packaged in most cars  another such option is the heated steering wheel  cant even tell it is on  the navigation system which ties to your phone scout gp is  worthless  it cant decipher what you are asking  neither my wife or i have had any luck with it trying business names addresses anything  havent tried the remote start via phone app yet but it is disappointing that a car in this price range doesnt have one standard  if it does end up working it t is free for one year then  per year afterwardstoo expensive will ultimately end up putting in an aftermarket starter  when we picked the car up they wasted too much time trying to sell add on packages and spent very little time explaining the features wasted time rebooting the entire car because the hands free tail gate wouldnt work  overall much less than the stellar buying experience lexus advertises  lexus obviously has a loyal base and as such is stingy with discounting but i would suggest giving similar cars a better look  over priced for what is delivered
Lexus,Price/Value, rx  i was so excited about finally getting the rx and im so disappointed with it weeks oldand it had this vibration soundwhich gets very loud and annoyingi mean this is a lexusyou pay so much money and this vibration noise is not acceptablethe more i readseems like everybody has the same issue with no fixi cant recommend this car to anyone and ill have to trade it in eventuallyso disappointed with lexus
Lexus,Engine/Performance,unhappy rx customer  please be sure to drive this vehicle in traffic and slow rpm has a shifting issue when you roll in and out of the throttle lexus says it is a characteristic of the vehicle it is very frustrating to drive and has turned me into a lexus hater shame on lexus qc would not purchase another
Lexus,Engine/Performance,small touches missing drivers cup holder storage under center console could use passenger dash tray no audible lane change alarm no engine shut off at stop bad phone compartment strangeshould be no charge for phone app
Lexus,Engine/Performance,excellence always check with edmundscom before making any decision on a vehicle
Lexus,Engine/Performance,my mistake this car is a perfect example of a good model gone bad  the drive train in the  is not smooth or powerful resulting in a herky jerky performance and uneven power even when the throttle is steady  it also has a way too soft suspension that results in instability when going over bumps at higher speeds such as on an interstate  the drive is comparable to a high mileage vehicle with weak shocks and struts  in addition the bluetooth set up is both confusing and difficult to navigate  so if you want a new model that is both unattractive because of grill styling  drives like a pig and is a step down in bluetooth this is the vehicle for you  ive owned lexus vehicles for nearly two decades and this is by far the worst vehicle that ive owned
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,new car for safety electronics navigation radio complex and  not intuitive need to study manual which is complicated
Lexus,Engine/Performance,not a high quality vehicle disappointed with the vibration and noise issue at  rpm range also disturbed by the hesitation
Lexus,Design/Style, do not buy until the fix the muffler  most of these car have or develop a low noise and vibrations lexus is aware of this issue but will not fix it its a well documented problem look under muffler noise problem or drone noise  not pleasant and not suitable for s luxury car dealer said thet are working on an issue for the past  months beware do not buy this car
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,a lot room for improvement as a luxury vehicle the front wind shield wiper makes annoying noise when the blade hits the left end  the newly designed rear wipers can not reach the lower left and upper right corner under raining condition and create blind spots  the acceleration peddle is very noisy when it is released and this should never happen to a luxury vehicle the discomfort seats give a feeling of riding on a cheap truck
Lexus,Design/Style,rx hater bought a  rx fully equipped loved it at the onset unfortunately it quickly developed a harsh noise and vibration around  to  mph the entire cabin vibrates and shakes i took it to the dealer and they told me lexus was aware of the problem and did not have any remedies i filed a complaint with the ncds national center for dispute settlement and lexus after about  weeks i was told that my claim cant be honored because i failed to prove that it is a manufactures defect  thoroughly drive this car to ensure it does not have the same problem check recallsgov for complaints that have been filed with the same problem  and  models are affected lexus will not fix this problem because they claim it does not affect the safety of the car look elsewhere
Lexus,Engine/Performance,expected way more from lexus me and my wife bought this rx almost a year ago and she drives it  of the time we are in our early sour first luxury vehicle previously owned isuzu  hondas toyota mazda and  subarus recently we took a road trip from chicago  miami   mile rt vehicle currently has  miles and after i read all the mixed reviews i decided to help the undecided except for  free scheduled maintenances  and  car was never in service for any issues exterior design you will either love it or hate it no comments here it is a matter of opinion the good  luxury interior design with quality and soft materials  very roomy and quiet cabin with absolutely no plastic squeaking  comfortable ride not too soft not too firm  very quiet updown window operation  lots of room in the back seat  adjustable rear seats  great basic speakers  very convenient front heating seats  under the trunk floor actual spare tire not like european competition just repair kit the bad  grinding drone noise while slow take off around  rpm reported to dealer during scheduled maintenance and the answer was vehicle is operating normally  transmission forcing higher gears  lower rpms to save gas this makes eco and normal modes annoying sport mode okay keeping higher rpms and lower gears makes the drive a pleasure  while idle lots of vibrations of steering wheel gear shifter and center console  throttle response is very very slow measured s  when i start the car during cold months it makes constant a loud knocking diesel like sound in the engine disappearing as vehicle warms up complained during  maintenance and technician takes me to another brand new rx we started it and it sound like mine he explained that high pressure fuel pump in the engine when its cold makes this type of sound and this is normal  using the infotainment is very difficult and screen menus are not intuitive at all  never know if ac is on or off no indicator light or old fashion basic onoff switch to check if ac is on or off you must  go thru complicated  menu screensunbelievable  ac compressor defaults to on even when its f outside   trip odometers switches are hidden on the left side behind steering wheel even when stopped it is hard to locate and reset trip odometer  the front passenger door needs heavy force to close i oiled it and closing is a bit smoother  on the passenger side the chrome window trim has about  dents which we discovered the next day after we purchased it looks like someone who installed the trim in the factory did this damage  transmission  is confusing sometimes and not sure what to do hesitates when you give gas when you add gas the throttle slowly responds and you ends up with one of two rabbit jump or turtle motion  automatic rear hatch closing or opening very very slow no beep signal when vehicle is locked from the key fob you are never sure from the distance if vehicle is secured  tiny holes on the seats makes it easy for crumbs to get stuck in   not even an option to order heated rear seats think and make your own decision before heading to store with your
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,great rideinstrumentation poor great ride but the instrumentation is not for the grey hairs control switches are scattered about and difficult to read software has nice features but requires a smart phone phone tech support is lacking as agents are not really knowledgeable about all the features gas mileage on a recent  trip averaged about  mpg frontal view is terrible as it is very difficult to judge where the real front is locatedbe careful
Lexus,Design/Style,what a steal waited four years before i found the car i wanted color make and model  be patient you too will find what you want
Lexus,Design/Style,what a steal waited four years before i found the car i wanted color make and model  be patient you too will find what you want
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,lexus discomfort having just completed an  miles road trip i have to report that both i and my wife found that the seats were not ergonomically supportiveon drives of only  miles we found that we both suffered from lower back pain especially in the passenger seatthe lumber support is quite inadequatei never suffered these pains when i drove my bmw x as much as  miles in one dayother criticisms of the car are  view of the clock is blocked by ones right arm the outside temperature numbers show very small there is no storage for glasses the trunk area has poor additional cubby spaces the reversing camera is poor  my kia sorento was much more accuratei would not buy another one
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,metal found in filter heads came off at  miles the head gaskets had to be replaced gave some lame reason blaming canada for that no extended warranty offered just sorry lets see dealer did oil change at  i had it done at  and the mech showed me metal in the oil filter since when are you ever suppose to have metal in the filter never the dealer says sorry but factory rep says normal not in my life time no customer support call the factory their answer since when do you buy a car from the factory lexus carlsbad shame on you dont buy
Lexus,Engine/Performance,heading for  this is my second lexus rx and i hope to get a third soon  i believe that says it all
Lexus,Engine/Performance,disappointment at its best the droning noise from the gear is driving me crazy the car hesitates and vibrates on lower speed the infotainment system crashs so often rattling noise that the dealer cannt figure out unreliable remote app wind noise from both sides factory defected so disappointed in my first and last lexus
Lexus,Engine/Performance,stay away from this vehicle if you are looking for lexus refinement you might get disappointed  some of these rxs  vibrate a lot during slow speed acceleration such as from a stop light when the engine rpms are under  rpms  lexus dealers and service managers are saying the vehicle is operating normally and this is a characteristic of this newly redesigned model  the transmission which is tuned for gas mileage also does a lot of gear hunting which its unsure what gear to be in so the transmission is always up shifting and down shifting constantly  ive owned the lexus brand since  and am so disappointed in this above  purchase
Lexus,Engine/Performance,engine drone upon accelaration the vehicle is subject to annoying engine drone upon initial acceleration issue acknowleged by majority of dealers lexus corporate states the vehicle is operating within normal perameters my first lexus will be my last lexus
Lexus,Engine/Performance,buyers remorse numerous idiotic design features that give you a pain in the butt too many to list so here are some highlights why does it only unlock the drivers door  once inside my friends have to wait while i fumble for the unlock button the onetouch rear hatch opener almost never works you cant listen to the radio and have your phone navigate like you could with a normal car  ac compressor defaults to on even when its freezing outside complicated menu sequence required to turn it off  distracted driving at its finest terrible throttle response you could get killed waiting for it to rev up and downshift through about  gears  you have to accelerate with a lead foot or else it upshifts too far and then has to downshift again it buzzes on a rough road  coming from the headliner area right side heater has numerous cold spots with cold air blowing on my left ear and foot unless you crank it up to about  degrees autodimming mirror doesnt work  you cant just flip it up cant even raise it high enough manually due to lack of travel why does the radio stop just because you start the engine am is totally muffled even with the treble and midrange cranked why wont the windows roll down unless the engine is running a manual crank would work better wtf is with the door locks i left the engine idling went around to the passenger side to get something and it refused to unlock so had to go back to the drivers side open the door and hit the unlock button and then walk around to the passenger side again the steering is way too stiff its worse on on the freeway than in a parking lot my old arthritic hands cant handle it i guess they  think thats sporty the steering wheel heater is nearuseless since it only heats small leather strips at  and  oclock  also it wont turn on automatically even though the seat heaters do you cant put your hands on the bottom of the wheel since theres a giant spoke blocking it do not buy this car unless you like to be frustratedupdate tried to find an suv i liked better volvo had better steering but was way too small on the interior at least the lexus has enough space too bad the seat wont go far enough back if its raised up high lowering it moves it back at a  degree angle lame im thinking about a buick lacrosse steering was nice and light not trucklike and the seat was pretty good there was enough room but not much more the midsized mercedes suv drove really nicely great steering feel and response and power interior is a bit too small though my right knee bangs on the consoleupdate took it in to get an oil leak fixed they had to pull the engine just to change a gasket then they damaged the oil cooler lines putting it back in took over a week had to scuttle our planned road trip which wasnt the worst thing since anywhere we wanted to go was  degreesto those who disliked this review i hope you enjoy your new pos dont say i didnt warn you
Lexus,Comfort/Interior, rx loaner for  rx k service first i have to be honest i have owned  rx s starting from  thru   the  is an awesome ride my wifes car i drive on weekends and enjoy it i do not like the dunlop tires but will soon be replacing yesterday we dropped the car off for service and were given a  rx as a loaner for the day we jumped on i and headed south from west palm beach to boca raton and stopped for a while first impressions hated the looks from the first time i saw it but figured it would grow on us but it hasnt  having said that my wife who is  and  pounds could not get comfortable at all  seats are way too hard and she actually wound up sitting side saddle to make it bearable  i am   pounds and the drivers seat in addition to being way too hard was way too thin and short i rented a highlander a few months ago and brought it back it was so uncomfortable this was the same in addition very cramped driver area compared to the  and the controls are crammed in and in dumb places  not intuitive at all this was a fully loaded premium top of the line model  we got past the fact that we felt like we were in a tight little car and then started to critique the driving feel and features it had radar controlled cruise control what a disaster way too sensitive found the car braking for cars in the adjacent lane at times and at one point took me from  to  in an instant terrible system had to shut it down  every once in a while upon acceleration a groaning noice came from out of nowhere couldnt stand it next and most important the steering is terrible dont know how to explain it other than notchy not smooth at all almost felt like it was sticking at certain points and had to be jerked back and forth on the highway then there was an annoying fan running in the rear loud didnt take the time to investigate but it was distracting on the way back from coconut creek to west palm we were back on i and again the steering is twitchy wandering and pulling and could not use the cruise control kept slowing me down i thought dangerously trying to take over driving  hated it look i am a lexus guy loved all my previous rx rides with the  as my favorite i do not enjoy critizing this car but seriously before you buy this car take it on the highway and give it a run  i will be looking elsewhere for my new car sorry lexus you blew this redesign big league
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,touchless back door i have had continuous problems with the touchless back door i have had it in to the dealer twice they could see that it doesnt work as advertised and made some adjustment i just learned to live with without it however the other day i walked around behind the rx in the garage on my way out and apparently i triggered something that caused the back door to open i did not realize it and backed out of the garage with the door open causing a lot of damage
Lexus,Engine/Performance,vibration uncharacteristic for lexus major problem with vibration at idle but much worse when accelerating at any speed refuse to take this  vehicle on long trips it has become an around town car and very disturbing that the dealer has no idea why its vibrating after experiencing and agreeing it is not normal lexus has also been called and they do have other vehicle with the same problem but to remedy or how to fix it pathetic to say the least as our family has had seven lexus vehicles and now that we have retired we downsized to one vehicle the rx not pleased with lexus or our dealer with a car just over  oh forgot to make note that the dealer has known about this problem when i brought this to their attention at  miles on the vehicle beware rx owners as you may not even realize you have a problem we purchased our rx in january  and the vibration has in my mind is caused by a faulty engine or transmission
Lexus,Design/Style,no longer trust lexus i bought rx  on nov  which is the first batch of that model onboard the us i finally give this review because i cannot tolerate the car any longer due to the low quality i purchased lexus because i trust the most reliable vehicle brand but the car i purchased makes me feel disappointed i cannot imagine such a luxury expensive car has problems that should not deliver to market following points are the issues that annoy me a lot	the floor of driver and passenger seats are not flat the inner side of the floor is higher than the outer side i never see the similar design on other cars we feel very uncomfortable every time when i or the passenger put feet on the floor imagine you sit in a luxury car but one leg high one leg lowi reported this issue to the dealer they said this is not a problem all other rx  are same i dont agree with them even all cars of this model are same it just indicates that the problem happens on all this model there is no excuse for such bad experience on such level of the car	the air conditioning system is noisythe air conditioning system has obvious noise when it runs after    minutes the noise sounds like somewhere of the car is leaking fluid i reported this issue to the dealer they acknowledged this problem and tried to fix it they replaced the refrigerating fluid but the issue is still there finally they said all other same model has this issue its not my cars problem its the problem of the air conditioner and the air conditioner is provided by a vendor of lexus	the mpg never reach the designed valuethe car specification says the mpg of this car is city hwy comb  i drive the car  on highway my highest mpg is  is this a kind of false propaganda give a number that cannot be reached by customers  i think this is same to the fake emissions incident happened on volkswagen	the passenger door needs heavier force to closethe passenger has to use heavier force to close the passenger door the same force can close other doors but cannot close passenger door i reported this issue to the dealer twice the first time they acknowledged the issue but engineer says they cannot fix it the second time they just said cannot repro this issue but  of the time my wife need to close the door twice failed one time and use heavier force to close it again	the car does not support unicode charactersi am not a native english speaker i often listen to songs with other languages like chinese japanese and korean i also have a lot of contacts that stored with chinese names the car shows all nonenglish characters as empty its  and its lexus i told this to a lot of people they all cannot believe lexus does not support a function that most other lower brand cars supportedabove problems annoy me every day every second when i use it i trust lexus so i decided to purchase it before i see the real car until now i still cannot believe this car is produced by lexus i also tried several months after i found these defects i hope i can tolerate these issues after i used to them finally i failed i feel very unhappy with this car it brings me a lot of pressure every day when i step on the slanted floor when i hear the noise when i ask my wife to close the door heavier when i listen to songs when i drive it i feel frustrated and worriment i think i cannot keep in this status any longer it is very dangerous to drive with it my wife also feel very scared when she hears the leaking voice she feels the car will explode sooner or laterso be careful when you are considering this car even considering lexus they are not as reliable as they said
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,not a totally great value some of ca curmudgeons comments sound like hes talking about a pre rxon my wifes  rx i agree that voice command doesnt work very well and the optional winter front floor mats were obviously designed by a committee of lawyers if lexus isnt willing to offer functional floor mats they just shouldnt offer any at allmy major complaint is with the overpriced navigation system which we didnt want to begin with it frequently suggests routes that are not efficient when engaged the map itself is usually accurate but the verbal and text directions are often  degrees wrong when i brought this to the attention of the dealers service department they suggested i buy an update with no guarantee the problem would be resolved this has spooked my wife to the point that i bought her a garmin nuvi  with lifetime updates and traffic and thats what we use in lieu of the builtinim not sure the frontal precollision system works the dealer was not willing to do a dynamic test
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,comfort and quiet
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,droning noise and poor response of accelerator test drive for a droninghumming noise around  rpmdealer does not want to say there is a problem but i test drove with the tech and shop foreman they eluded to the noise is from a possible redesign of exhaust systemthere may not be a safety issue but it is sure a let down for being a lexuswe test drove one on the lot and did not notice the noise we then went into the showroom to make the deal and my wife saw this one on the show room floorit was late at night and we did not drive it until we headed home if we had driven it we would have not purchased itthe accelerator is not responsiveif you coast and then press on accelerator you have to keep pushing then it kicks down in a lower gearthis car had a k sticker pricecant believe it is a lexusgive me back my sedan
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,flying ole lady like the rx but the transmission is so rough i cant believe it is a lexus like regular gas instead of hightestcomfortable in both front and back seats   disappointed in low gas mileage  had by  rx hybrid and i liked it betterhave since started using high octane gas ans shifts better but still not smooth like a lexus should be  still disappointed had a recall on hatchback door openerhusband took car to huntsville al lexus dealer and they adjusted the ecu and it shifts much better  still disappointed in smoothness of shifting
Lexus,Engine/Performance,hope  changes controls difficult to see and use because theyre behind the gear shift nav screen is gaudy compared to prior year models
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,windshield problem dont buy the heads up display if you want to buy the rx  with heads up display i suggest you wait i bought this car in march of  and the windshield has a problem there is a double vision where the all the lights cars traffic lights street lights are doubled the dealer changed it once and the problem is still there the deal says this is the was lexus designed the windshield which is a lie i contacted lexus customer satisfaction team and they believed the dealer without even inspecting the car i warn you from buying these cars it has other minor problems too such a waist of money paid  thinking that its a luxury car i think i will go back to bmw and audi
Lexus,Engine/Performance,disapointed this car is not as refined as the past rx suv the shifting is rough and the  speed tranny is very rough  it seems like it is not sure  sometime between  and  i think they should remap the trans i finally  just use manual and use  and that stops all the up and back shifting for now the engine is very loud and i hate thati  i really think lexus should give is some help with these things my truck rides  better and quit too
Lexus,Engine/Performance,buyers remorae this is my rd rx   with each generation the navigation and other electronic controls get more complex and harder to use  for some reason instead of getting faster and more responsive over the years the computer in this car is slower and less intuitive than the earlier models  it is on its way to the dealer for the second time because the screen has blacked out and now freezes on occasion  i pay for the traffic package and it is not unusual to drive  miles after starting the car for the traffic info to show on the screen  and compared to an app like waze it is very dumb and likely to lead you into a traffic jam and then cheerfully chirp slow traffic  if i could get out of this lease i would
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,disappointed poor infotainment system poor acceleration very poor steering and you cannot lock the doors and disable the alarm together thereby making it impossible to leave my dog in the car without fear of theft   nice luxury  though the seats are a little hard
Lexus,Engine/Performance,try again  rx i own a    rx i had my  serviced and they gave me a  rx as a loaner  i am not happy with the ugly black plastic around the wheel wells of the  as it looks so cheap for a luxury car the front seats are so hard that my back and buttocks were hurting even after trying to adjust the seating  the navigation and entertainment is difficult to operate while driving i dont have this issue in my  or   the engine noise while accelerating is horrible it sounds like cyl engine struggling to move the car  this is not something that i would expect from lexus  the inside looks absolutely fantastic however using the technology is difficult  the ac sounds as if its about to blow me away however living in houston tx i can appreciate that it cools very quickly as our summers can be brutal so i can deal with the noise i guess  my  is not as noisy but it does take a minute to cool off in texas heat  i hope lexus makes some changes to the  rx as i will not purchase this generation rx
Lexus,Engine/Performance,my th rx what a big disappointment in the new rx  i loved all of my other cars and did not have a major complaint other than the navigation system the  is even worse i just dont get it at allvery difficult to use the whole radionavigation is so delicate to the touch and difficult to figure out i also do not like the loud sound of the air conditioning system another issue i have is when i start the car it makes a loud knocking sound in the engine which i am told is normal for this model one very big problem we have is the odor in the car it does not have that new car smell that we all love but rather a musty mildew smellthe dealership advised us to use frebreeze so all in all i wish i could get out of this lease and am so unhappy that is is nothing like my previous  rxs that i loved
Lexus,Price/Value,ecstatic although i only have my vehicle for one week i couldnt be happier
Lexus,Engine/Performance,somewhat disappointed like many of the loyal lexus owners  this is my rd rx    this is the first time ive written any review on the rx    the previous were  and  version   they both were great    although i did read all the negative comments  but   i still went for this rd rx  thinking it cant be that bad  well  after one week in this vehicle   i can now see and feel all the complaints in the previous reviews pros   sportier look mean looking grill  excellent interior finish  i just had it one week  could not comment on the reliability   but the same lexus quality is apparent in this vehicle   great warranty and service of the lexus dealership cons    navagation and audio control function logics  sucks   its complicated and difficult and operation very illogical   dont even think about making changes  delete  during driving   the difficulty in operating the navigation system makes it very hazardous during driving     id give this a  star  very poor     what happened here    why didnt the lexus design engineers adopt to the simple mature and logical operation commands of the current gps in the market place     this is a major disappointment     although i love the  display  but the operation and controls simply way too cumbersome and  poorly designed audio control  complicated and difficult to set and navigate during driving   and not responsive at all   there  seemingly a few seconds delay   previous lexus version the response was swift and quick   very poor design   it makes the operation very frustrating and takes the enjoyment out of  music  the little mouse pointeryou have to be exactly and precisely deadon and the pointer is so so so so sensitive   very difficult to land  exactly on the target   very bad design   very distracting especially during driving     dont attempt to operate this during driving  very hazardous      my other car is a bmw the  control is so much easier and accurate to operate    lexus lexus  whats gotten into you     the doors are very heavy to open and close comparing to previous models       the gear shifting in all my previous rx  are smooth as silk   although  there were noise  it was more like the exhaust noise   but  in the  rx  the  noise   especially during  startup acceleration   the humming sound from the engine seems louder  but the worst part  is the gear shift are a bit rough and no longer smooth     the  rx and my bmw  series the gear shifts very quiet and so smooth   its hardly noticeable   but  this  rx   it is very noticeable   well  after all this is said   this is still a good suv to have   im just a bit disappointed and a bit anxious to finish the current lease of my rx  and move on to the next one  hopefully a much better car in the future
Lexus,Design/Style,very pleased used as family vehicle and often for hauling merchandise from stores and bikes and other recreational equipment  pulls a small  lb  utility trailer as if it isnt there  have spent  on repairs in  miles only regular maintenancesynthetic oil and one set of tires  first were replaced after  miles  nothing not to like  we will trade for a toyota or honda unfortunately will not buy a  lexus because we think its ugly and ungainly looking  drove to  miles and sold  still no problems at all  traded in for a toyota highlander larger and uses regular gas sold and bought toyota
Lexus,Engine/Performance,disappointing i had high hopes for this vehicle but sadly it didnt deliver its built like a toy never again
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,lack of cubbies where do you put your stuff in this carno place for pens note pads etc for the driverthe storage in the center console is very difficult to accessand the cell phone charger setup that has got to be improved
Lexus,Design/Style,archaic  nav system first of all why hasnt edmunds talked about the archaic navradio system in any of their reviews i come from the world of fordsiriussync and i was shocked when i realized how oldfashioned the lexus system isyes i know i should have kept it for a weekend to discover what a terrible system it is  but i listened to friends who were already lexus owners and i read edmunds reviews and no one told mehave these people never driver another brand of caryou have to jump to two screens to see the title of a song and then jump back to get to the next channelno color no logos just plain old letters that are truncated  you dont even see the whole song title
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,previous rx owners might be dissapointed  i traded in my  rx with over  and i miles and i miss itprevious rx owners might want to spend a weekend with this car before making a decisionmy main complaint is the poorly designed interiorwhen you cant fit your owners manual in the glove compartment  poor designwhen you have to take your eyes off the road to turn on the seat heater  poor designthe driver has to reach behind to get something out of the storage compartmentthe list goes onfeel the weight of the glove compartment door or the weight of the carpet  they dont come close to previous modelsthis is my third lexus in ten years i feel let down by a friendthey can do better than this
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,rippled windshield we had just purchased our third lexus plus our sixth toyota my husband was having dizzy spells and horrible headaches after thousands of dollars in medical bills we found out that there was a ripple in the windshield that was causing this took car into lexus said they could not fix this and there was nothing more todobut when they had it in the shop that day they gave us a rental same make and model and same year and no ripple they told us it was a  when we brought it back a different car porter told us that it was a in fact a nonpermissible content removed customer service in lexus headquarters said they can not do anything either they are aware of the defect
Lexus,,lumpys suv
Lexus,,lexus rx
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,lexus lover nothing beats the value reliability comfort of lexus suv i only wish the navigation was state of the art this is my th rx
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,no good expiensive car but can not even read mp music usb filemy  of kbps song now can not be played
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,diehard jeep fan who crossed over after only driving the jeep grand cherokee for  plus years we decided on the lexus rx  because its a beautiful looking car and we wanted something different i keep looking in the reviews to see does anyone else have the same complaint as usthe drivers seat sits way too low visibility is terrible thank goodness we got the navigation which shows whats behind you when backing upwhen the drivers window is rolled down and you put your arm outyour arm has to rest on an upward angle i saw someone state they had an accidentno wonder it really makes me nervous on the highway truei am short but my husband who is  foot says the same thing
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,bad suspension in  lexus  rx after having a  lexus  rx for  years i was thrilled to get a new   rx last octobervery quickly i began to realize that the ride and the drive were clearly not the samethe  is the roughest ride everi have complained at the dealership and had it checked out and they say everything is as it should be but i continue to bounce and rock sideways over the slightest bumpsalso the cargo pad is worthlessit is thin and has no substance and has wrinkled into a gnarly messthe dealership says we had to have closed the cargo door on it and that just did not happen the  was a stronger fabric and much higher quality
Lexus,Engine/Performance, lexus rx lexus is world class in its cars and suvs but the new rx falls short in a few areas see below
Lexus,Design/Style,dont believe the few bad reviews do not believe the few bad reviews here  i strongly believe in my opinion only that these are spies from the other car companies the closest competitors writing some of this nonsense  just a warning  use your common sense  i have owned the car for almost a year now   fact  it is the smoothest and quietest suv you can buy  people are posting that its a little trucky but there is a little truth to that but please note this is the best of all competitors out there  fact center console does fail miserably in design  but i can live with it  i just drove to the sequioas and a new x overheated i just zoomed by laughing  fact lexus is the most reliable car available
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,bumper defect several problems with my wifes car  first the front right bumper pops out since the car was new  the dealership says we damaged it but we didnt  access to the charger is difficult if not impossible  controls for seat heaters are difficult to access  changing the tirp computer is impossible while driving because the controls are obscured by the steering wheel  also the general quality of materials is poor easily scratched with normal use  for instance the plastic trim in rear hatch scratches easily if brushed with objects placed into the car  after a short while there are many scratches and abrasions appearing  materials less durable than bmw or land rover
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,rough riding rx  my leased  rx   wd rides like a cement truck  i have been told to carry bags of rocks in the back to improve the ride i have a lemon and lexus people say it is not broken and rides as it was designed do yourself a favor and never own this lexus model  we hate to drive this car never again
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,remote control if you are ready to purchase a lexus suv or other toyota vehicle do not get remote start  it doesnt work as this is the first year theyve had it and havent been cooperating to fix it  claim the signals are not communicating between the vehicle and key  you have to stand  ft from the vehicle to activate it  very bad feature  even some dealers that are honest will tell you this  also back hatch has to be lifted some to get it to go up automatically  if doing it manually
Lexus,Price/Value,my new  rx  lexus rxinconvenient driver storage areas the only convenient area is the door pocket which conveniently expandsthe shelf under the center console is very difficult to accessthe lexus remote touch system is impressive but not efficient to usegps system  salesman said the database can be updated he didnt say itll cost my biggest disappointment  cd playerwindow sticker listed under standard equipment disc cd changeron right under accessoriessingle cddvd playerdeceivingsince it was listed under standard equipment i thought i was paying for a disc cd changeri didnt catch this sleight of hand switch
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,hate the new  rx  let me start my review by saying that i loved my  rx why havent i read that the  rx  has a much stiffer suspension and harder seatseven my husband who doesnt care about comfort in car has noticed that the seats are hard i leased the  rx  non sport modelnon sport and it has a very harsh bouncy ride i so wish that i had not turned in my  for this model
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,enform the lexus emform suite is poorly designed and never should have been released there are numerous bugs the most annoying being the failure of pandora to operate dealer had no answers or fix saying lexus is working on the issues its fairly obvious that productsoftware testing was not adequate prior to releasing
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,i did my research and lost anyway this was the car i wanted and could afford  found one at an acura dealer with only  miles and admittedly bought asis with brand name confidence  a few months later told needed complete steering rack replaced due to torn boot this just doesnt happen over night  mechanic said common defect on toyotalexus products  i didnt know this  oil pan gasket also leaking  needs  new rear tires recently had to replace radiator and water pump  that amounts to almost  in repairs  what else is going to break down
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,nice luxurious suvstrange lack of features we got this car for an insane deal from a family member only issue is a rear hatch that sometimes has a mind of its own and closes right when it opens up in power mode we have to open it manually every so often especially in the cold otherwise it only has required oil changes and basic maintenance its really quick smooth refined and luxurious its extremely quiet inside and the interior has nice materials the seats have bad leg supportmy legs hang off of the end of the drivers seat otherwise its extremely nice it does handle pretty bad however with a slightly tippy feeling and some of the worst steering of any car ive driven it feels like a video game with no feedback and is scary in the rain especially the car also lacks bluetooth and usb or aux imports which is unacceptable in a  luxury car our former  mazda had these
Lexus,Price/Value,transmission slips at  miles i bought this car as a cpo  months ago  miles on it  the transmission slips when i slow down like to turn or in traffic and then step back on the gas the car revs but its like its in neutral then i hear a thump and it lurches forward  or it will shudder for a second then thud and lurch forward  i have been to the dealership x already they say there is nothing wrong this is how the car is designed to drive  a car this expensive should not drive like this i called lexus and i am awaiting a response back
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,navigation flaws we bought a fully loaded  rx  fwd with the mark levinson sound system and navigationbluetooth system  the biggest disappointment has been these integrated system  most of the buttons on the touchscreen are greyed out while moving so that no destination or telephone no can be entered using the screen  not even by the passenger  who could safely interact with the system the voice activated system is awful taking forever to navigate simple prompts  similarly while moving the radio will not display text info about the playing song using the full screen  you can however watch the info slowly scroll by five letters at a time on the little radio screen risking life and limb
Lexus,Engine/Performance,inadequate low beams the first time i drove my  ls  at night i thought i did not have my headlights properly turned oni could not see well enough to drive over  mphwhen i called the dealer the technition mentioned that i was the third person that week to make the same complaint so i left it for diagnosisresult no problem everything checked out to specswhen i pushed the saftey issue i basically got a shrug and was told that the headlight system takes a while to get used toi got caught in a rainstorm on the interstate last night and had to slow down to  mphi could not see anything but other cars were passing by with no problemanyone else
Lexus,Price/Value,headlights i find the headlights dangerous they cast a shadow and it is difficult to see the road when the road is unlit the dealership says they cannot be adjusted im very disappointed that such an expensive car could have such a bad defect

Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,over priced big problem with the odometer  mileage may read  and ill drive around the block and the odometer will read   for  the odometer changed about  mile more than actual miles driven dealership keys said this is a problem with is year  ls  and theres nothing they can do  i have kept the car because of the loss in trade in value because of mileage  current reading is  should be around  i have three cars i drive and im retired
Lexus,Price/Value,avoid at all costs i have always owned lexus cars but the newer models have gotten so unnecessarily complex that they are prone to very expensive failures  i could go on and on but take for example the most recent failure of the navigation unit  at only k pampered miles the screen just up and dies  now not only does this screen control the gps but it also controls the climate controldefrost rear view camera stereo including radiocd changer  so this one gadget failing has rendered the car undriveable no defrost  to get it replaced is ksix thousand dollars and not covered by warranty even though the car only has k miles  this is bad engineering plain and simple
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,my new ls problems  drivers seat not comfortable  feels like you sit in a hole and perforated seats dont permit you to move easily  no good way to run xm antenna in the trunk  hard to see orange letters on display too small  ride too hard with low profile tires
Lexus,Price/Value,all but the transmission i traded a  es for an  ls because of the jerky transmission shifting  the ls isnt much better at a slow roll shifting is very erratic  again the mechanics say its normal  for k the transmission or computer that controls it shouldnt be confused  sadly my k dodge pickup shifts much better seamless for a fourth of the cost  big disappointment

Lexus,Design/Style, lexus  the quality and workmanship are supurb
Lexus,Engine/Performance,the finest  luxury sedan in the world this sedan is very quiet and the
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,incredibly mediocre i bought this after  bmws and did so because service is so awful on bmws in southern california lexus service is truly amazing and so far ahead of any other car type that it is hard to believe however this car is like driving down the road on a jello square it handles loosely and because of the continuously variable transmission it feel like you are driving a motor boat more than a car
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,lexus gs h  nice but not great i received one of the first lexus gs h hybrid sedans  i had been driving an ls model  the gs definitely feels like a step down in luxury  i have been getting a disappointing  miles per gallon  the interior feels cramped compared to the ls  however the gs hybrid has plenty of power and is fun to drive  i would think twice before spending the extra money to get the hybrid model of this car
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,our piece of crap lexus we bought this car in november before thanksgiving and i wish we would not have we compared it between the tahoe and escalade and decided to go with the lexus because of the resale value what i really hate this car because of the lack of trunk space with the third row folded up and the big bulky wd shifter most manufactures have put wd at the touch of a button and lexus desided to leave it as a shifter to take up half of center console because of the positioning of the shifter and wd shifter you have to reach around to control the heated seat controls which gets old real quick the transmision is all so a joke because it has shifted into a higher gear as soon as i begin to lay into it
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,disappointing i have been so disappointed with this truck that in the middle of my lease i ordered a bmw x im going back to this better performing more luxurious suv  the gx  is boring to drive  it lumbers down the highway like a full sized american car  the premium sound system is no better than average  the gas mileage is worse than the x  i rarely get more than  mpg  the interior is average  the leather and wood trim are not nearly as nice as what is offered by bmw or audi  overall i paid  for this truck and its worth about   i cant wait to get back into a bmw
Lexus,Engine/Performance,made a mistake it kills me to admit i made a mistake purchasing this vehicle every complaint i read previously about the vehicle manifested with my new gx  less than k miles and i kept experiencing grinding brakes and the clunk the clunk is a noise it makes after stopping it causes the car to shift slighltly forward and feels as if someone tapped the bumper when i showed the dealer a tsb report they were forced to fix it
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,over priced car i have had this car for  months now with  miles on it and i should have walked into the toyota dealer next door and looked at the land cruiser for a lot less i am a big guy and this car is hard to enter and even women say that the gas mileage is terrible i think lexus did a great advertising campaign to sell this overpriced car the effort it takes to remove the rear seats is unreal and you would have to have no legs to sit in them
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,traded  rx  for  gx  purchased this vehicle because of reliability this is third lexus purchased we needed third row seats and wanted dvd for grandchild gx  has ample power to tow heavy trailers and climb steep mountain roads gas mileage and ho hum agility are the only downsides but have is  for daily use and it gets  mpg
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,worst lexus ever this gx is my second and last lexus  shakes like a model t at  mph  brakes stop the car with a loud and shaking klunk at the end of the stop  nav system is woefully out of date  all the dealer can tell me is lexus is aware of your problems but doesnt have a fix at this time  bad answer
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,"th lexustoyota product its the worst so disappointed in this vehicle horrible ride  hate the tailgate  wecall it the weeble because it wobblesin turns  consistent issue withtransmission which they are apparentlyunable to fix as it comes back againand again  seriously considering lemonlaw on this one as another reviewer isaw here  i have few good things to sayabout this vehicle"

Lexus,Comfort/Interior,over rated  suv i was very disappointed in the comfort
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,poor trade in value purchased my gx new in  very comfortable rise and fun to drive outstanding dvd and sound system multicddvd exchanger hard to reach arm rest on front seats are annoying as they keep locking in up positions poor gas mpg  third row seating  cramped worst complaint is depreciation value pd  new   yrs later trade in value is k  k k  k lost in   yrs  unbelievable
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,traded ours i have always purchased bmws but decided to get a lexus for a change  i just traded it in and went back to bmws  the suv is very well made but is awful to drive  we actually felt unsafe in ours
Lexus,Engine/Performance,boring suv very boring suv its quiet and smooth and reliable but not for people who like to drive and its good offroad and without kdss additional option the truck isnt very stable and to top it off it loses a lot of market value

Lexus,Comfort/Interior,mamas car my dad and my mom bought this car after my mom had been looking for months when i first saw he car i thought it looked decent we happened to be at an away game for my school and i could not wait to get to ride home in the car but then the second i got in the car i was so disappointed i could hardly fit in the back seat there is absolutely no room also another problem that we had was the navigation screen i mean my family was so confused cause you run the climate from that screen the radio the dvd player and everything else that would have been a lot easier just to make buttons for my family has not liked this car at all i mean  mpg highway i mean come on just dont get this car
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,squeaky breaks bought car brand new squeaky brakes when car had  mi initially intermittent then became consistent multiple dealer services not solved was told by service adivor  manager common for these cars in fact was told many new lexus vehicles squeak and nothing can be done what a disappointment were not talking about pintos here no vote of confidence from lexus trained personnel would not recommend lexus base on above comments from a service manager and adviser buyers beware can you imagine spending premium dollars and was told they naturally squeak car is still new
Lexus,Price/Value,mine is a lemon my gx  has had and continues to have problems with the navigation radio rear camera console it is currently at the dealers for the third time   days so far  still they are not able to diagnose and or fix the problemsthey have replaced the radio head twice without fixing the problem it is probably time to ask for a new one or have them refund my money
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,abs system buzz distractive therere high frequency squeaks buzz fr under the dash every  brake pedal application in my new gx it makes me feel uncomfortable  distractive when im driving however lexus said it is caused by abs braking system and it is a normal characteristic from abs actuator and no repairs are necessary it could be a normal characteristic if actuator buzz from outside car and do not bothering people in the car however it is problem if a noise is annoying people inside the car this is definitely an unsafe driving condition to any driver i purchased lexus wthe high expectation of its qualityservices  but i experience the absolutely worst i have ever had i need help  good advise
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,does not fit  car seats in nd row i saw a posting that it fits multiple car seats in the nd row  this is not a correct statement  one car seat will fit fine but due to the position of the nd latch behind the drive it will not probably hold the car seat still  it is not positioned on par with federal guidelines   nhtsa certified fireman said he could not properly install the seat due to the positioning as it of center  so dont buy if you need multiple carseats in the nd row
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,overpricedoverated this lexus gx has been a headache since the day it was purchased since new the interior materials are cheap rivaling fisher price products the seats are hard and unsupportive the suspension sqeaks and the dealer cant fix it etc the car also suffers from technology that is slow frustrating to use and severely outdated for a  liter v power is minimum with poor braking to assist it the steering is very vague  the car has had  unexpected visits to the dealer fortunately covered from warranty did i mention rust this car is already rusting with it only covering  miles the good points of this car include the dealer being easy to work with and lots of room with the seats folded for a  car this car is in no way worth it
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,size does matter the size
Lexus,Service/Maintenance, lexus gx leaning to passenger side i have  lexus gx that is at the shop for leaning to passenger side when you drive the car sometimes it feels like the car have the front flat tire and its not the car by it self is lowered one left side i mean the hood is lower to the groun than the right side took it to dealership and they everything is by specs even it does show when u measures with tape measure from ground to the fender one side is lower then the other one for like a inch not satisfied with that
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,lexus enform does not work that fancy tech package that might buy does not work i bought my gx   days ago april  the enform app is down with no date planned to fix the issues do not buy this or any lexus if you want the apps to work demand that the dealer demonstrate all of the features before you buy they wont because they cant its crap i have called both the dealer and lexus they will not help buy the audi i wish i had
Lexus,Price/Value,what an expensive mistake i use my  lexus gx  all day every day and i am reminded of how much i regret my purchase my only consolation is the smooth ride and it ends there the gps is not accurate telling you you have arrived if you are in the vicinity i do not expect the gps to drop me off at the exact location but at least bring me to the right street also when you are close enough in their opinion it tells you to look at the the map i am not new to gps cars and this is the worst ive ever used even the ford focus car rental gps is way better i find myself using my phone to navigate which is counter productive considering i supposedly have a gps in the car another concern is you have to press the screen x to just get air conditioning adjust the amount of air or change direction of air this is a hazard when driving the apps also do not work i cannot even use the pandora and always get a tether error how can lexus make electronics so complicated than what they should be  their engineers should test drive and use their electronics to experience the pain of using it horrible
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,new gx  bought this car after driving runners for  years considered it to be more luxurious version of my previous cars finding so many features i dont like needs hitest gas poor gas mileage poor interior design cup holders in awkward posituon less accessible places for change etc awkward sideopening back door does not protect me from rain awkward loading large packaged
Lexus,Engine/Performance,bulletproof reliability  but terrible otherwise this suv is built like a tank with reliability durability and longevity second to none the interior is nicely done and of course its off road prowess is also second to none the ride is also surprisingly comfortable and absorbent for a true bodyonframe suv designed to tackle some really tough terrain sadly that is where the positives end the gx masquerades as a luxury vehicle when it is not luxurious in the least there is more to a luxury vehicle than putting some leather and some fancy gadgets inside the gx has one of the absolute worst powertrains there is the engine is simply horrendous it is extremely noisy sounding like a vacuumcleaner on the slightest of grades even on the freeway at about  to  mph the exhaust drone gets very tiring after a while pretty shocking for so called luxury vehicle the engine is also not the smoothest and pretty bad actually for a v there are some on here that have stated that this vehicle is extremely quiet these folks are likely certifiably deaf if they cant here the constant droning from the engine which is the worst from around  rpm to around  rpm that was an absolute deal breaker for me and it is why i got rid of mine even though this was a very difficult decision as i do consider reliability as one the top most important aspects of  a vehicle in short i do not recommend this vehicle at all if it were a bare bones vehicle it would probably be ok but for a high end luxury vehicle it is a joke
Lexus,Engine/Performance,gx  please do not buy i had old model gx for  years and i purchased new gx expecting betterbut it was my big mistakenew gx is larger heavier suv but lexus engineers put smaller engine it is so underpowered and i have hard time to go up hills to my home and afraid to pass any car in the freewaymy son has refused to drive this suv because too dangerous to pass any car in highways and handling is so poor in the california mountain highways i am ready to return this suv if lexus take it backi know why lexus sales are going down their design skills are so poor in many items and need vast improvement
Lexus,Design/Style,fail lexus the buick of japanese automakers this is my th lexusin hindsight i should have bought something elsei dont know if ill buy another one lexus has gotten complacent and are seeing declining sales for this very reason they had an opportunity to improve the gx instead they have made a series of poor design decisions and dropped the ball on acceptance criteria which resulted in a subpar and dated product making it to market right out of the gate couple examples and it gets worse  rx has compass in mirror offroad suv does not have to use remote to turn on rear ent no way via nav lexus needs to respond to complaints and do something instead of just giving lip service no longer the lexus of old

Lexus,Engine/Performance,acceleration i have had the same issued since the date of purchase  from a stop when you accelerate the vehicle has a stall or hesitation for  or  seconds  this does not occur every time thus creates a problem for lexus  i have complained to lexus and gone through the hearing process which is a waste of time  the representatives from lexus and the hearing panel drove the vehicle across the street from the hotel and around the costco parking lot and said the vehicle did not demonstrate a problem the vehicle has a problem
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,overpriced gasguzzling clunky dinosaur one word to describe this suv compared to others in its class would be overpriced you are simply not getting anything worth its hefty tag of k lets start with what it is lacking that suvs  its price haveno lane assist no panoramic sunroof or power sunshade manual only no quiet cabin i clearly hear all road noise and the super irritating noise of the fans whenever the cooledheated seats or cabin controls are on anything but lowno excuse for this cheap design no touch pad screens no color changing ambient lighting no choice of engines no keypad for phone dialing no easy interface i am very good with technology but this thing is a joke no rear usb ports no digital clock only a hardtoread analog one in addition it has poor leg room in the third due to bad floor design poor cargo space due to poorly designed folding seats and ready for this oneit comes with a car starter but you only get to use it for one year before they force you to pay for their lexus enform app to keep it going no yearly  app  no starter the drive is so clunky and tipsy around turns that i would compare it to navigating a tall cinder block on lego wheels oh and the split truck is actually a big pain bc they forgot to add power to the lower hatch so if you have something heavy in your arms you have to set it on the ground to manually open the dang lower trunk first the controls are in horrible spots coffee cups will block the single usb port and phone cubby no other place for your phone i have to constantly take my eyes of the road to try to navigate through the dinosaur limited options screen and buttons seriously every question i have for lexus on if there is something i might be missing is met with a resounding no unless you think it is ok to pay k for a vehicle that raises and lowers no big deal since many other suvs do this too and youre ok with getting mpg bc they didnt bother to improve consumption then save yourself from this headache and buy something else anything else
Lexus,Price/Value,dont buy this if u live in nyc it does poor in not good in snow not good

Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,safety my wife and  month old were just in a severe accident an run off the road into a telephone pole that completely crushed the car  my wife and baby left with only a slight bump on her head  we are going to get another one immediately  safety is everything
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,disappointed purchased this vehicle because it is a hybridlow emissions and better intown gas mileage than our mb e  we do most of our driving around town  we are very disappointed in the city gas mileage which is  to  mpg  not the  mpg we expected  the dealer and lexus blows our complaints off  we live in a coastal area meaning the closest we come to a mountain is a bridge  our city driving meets lexus statement for the  mpg  however we do get  mpg on the interstate  go figure otherwise we very much like the vehicle
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,hopeful we purchased this vehicle in october   we love driving it  we are very disappointed with the gas mileage so far  there is something wrong with the regeneration  we are getting better gas mileage on the highway than in the city  we are hopeful that this will be addressed when we take it in  we were waiting until we had about  miles on the vehicle
Lexus,Service/Maintenance, miles and no issues okay so the car looks a bit boring but well over  miles without a single maintenance issue  this car just keeps going and going  keeping my fingers crossed on the hybrid battery but no signs of any issues
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,never again ive had many luxury vehicles and this one by far has needed the most repairs and had the wierdest most difficult to diagnose problems of them all             my mercedes never had an issue and routine maintenance was a pleasure with loaner car service  my grand cherokees have been somewhat maintenance prone but dead on schedule and ultrareliable this thing  im afraid to drive it anywhere  theres a shudder in the front end that nobody seems to be able to fix even after replacing brakes all around including calipers and rotors cv axles struts bushings and wheel bearings   the mileage is absolutely horrible  at best  the gps is akward and outdated and updates are definitely not worth the cost  there is no way to add an auxiliary input for audio from any other source the back seat passengers can modify your gps entries from the rear seat entertainment system and you cannot stop them from doing so because you cant make that system stay off if they turn it back on  the car has horrible body roll in corners worse than any other vehicle ive driven in  years of driving  the button and control layout of vital things like defrost and cruise control are all unintuitive ly placed or are a reach to get to forcing you to take your eyes off the road  i drive about k miles a year and this has been the worst  ill never buy another lexus
Lexus,,our rx
Lexus,Service/Maintenance,disappointed that we arent even getting mpg im not sure yet on how this lexus will do with reliability but i do love lexus i never write these things but i am very disappointed that we arent even getting mpg the dealership told me this vehicle was never designed to get good mpg just cleaner emissions and slightly more horsepower over the  i would still buy an rx or gx but not the hybrid i paid extra thinking i would save on gas and am very disappointed
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,feel totally let down we were thrilled with this car when we first got it a great comfortable family car for long journeys and a greener option for the city we knew the fuel economy wasnt going to be great but the fact that you knew you werent going to be churning out fumes in slow moving traffic was the main winning point i walk a lot in town and hate going past slow moving traffic with my kids  it stinks after a few months the car would not start and ever since weve had serious starting issues new batteries didnt last and the problem persists internet searches show many others with the same problem lexus shockingly unhelpful
Lexus,Comfort/Interior,goodyear tires dont do it this is my second lexus suv  my first hybrid  and i am sorry i did not stay with the rx the hybrid attraction doesnt live up to expectations simply because the battery vents take up valuable floor storage space and the weight of the battery over time causes the goodyear tires to chop making the vehicle ride extremely rough  i was just told that my second set of new tires put on after  miles are not wearing properly  i have a little over  miles on the car  i have written to lexus however my past attempt to get them involved on this issue took a village and eventually they deferred me to goodyear  goodyear refused to do anything this time
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,lexus hybrid just got the car this month  the mileage is a little less than advertised but its a fun car to drive with pop when you need it
Lexus,Design/Style,h not suitable for winter with ice the h was the first hybrid we owned and we paid a premium at the time we would not buy a hybrid again we live in canada and travel every weekend to snowy conditions the hybrid is underpowered on the rear axle since it is powered by an electric motor in situations where the front wheels have low traction and the rear has to take the load it does not perform we have several friends in british columbia who twill not take this vehicle up a  driveways if there is snow and ice bottom line this is not a  wheel it is an all  wheel with insufficient torque in the rear drive train for winter conditions due to a lack of power design in the rear electric drive train t
Lexus,Mileage/Fuel,poor gas mileage we purchased this vehicle solely for the gas mileage that was claimed on the sticker and what the dealer said it would actually get  we were very disappointed when it got  less then what they claimed  around the city the best we were able to achieve was  mpg when the sticker and dealer claimed it would get  mpg or better  we even had a factory rep from lexus drive the car and he could not get it over  mpg  this car is terrible  lexus would not stand behind it and told us that there was nothing they would do  we lost k selling it back to the dealer
Lexus,Engine/Performance,poorly built you should think twice before buying this vehicle i am only  and when delivered the front seats of my h would not go back far enough and had to be unbolted and moved at a  expense to me also my head is against the roof with the seat all the way downthe front seat belts are too short and extensions have to be used which compromise safety the car lunges forward usually in park when it switches from electric to gas engine gas use runs  mpg in town and  mpg on the road it has been back to the dealer and they say there is nothing wrong with the vehicle
BMW,Comfort/Interior,ok with reservations we picked this car as a cpo from a bmw dealer  no problems to date  relatively decent handling for the type car and just the right size and height  we stayed away from the newer version to avoid a mini based front wheel platform derived car as opposed to a bmw based one  the new  x also features a flimsy cloth covering under the moonroof that i can see ripping quickly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         if you want a x like this may i suggest springing for the upgraded interior  base level seating has poor lateral support and are unacceptable  base halogen headlights are unacceptable and should be avoided  my  series coupe has xenons which are light years better  sorry  base sound system is mediaocre at best  i dont understand the need for moonroofs on bmws and wish they would apportion the monies elsewhere and delete them  acceleration with the  hp is considerably better than you would expect for a  cyl  it feels like a   braking is only adequate  but some experts blame this on the stock tires rather than the car  i also would like a manual transmission x like they have in other countries  when youre shopping seek out a well optioned example only  a base car sporting only a badge is bad form indeed
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,worst purchase ive ever made 	dealership was a joke to work with lied on two separate occasions about frivolous things	electronics keep tripping  dealership has no idea its not logging 	o sensor light comes on every time i go down my parking garage and stays on for the remainder of the trip dealership has no idea what to do 	key fob lasted  years  bucks for a new one excluding programming costs 	gas mileage nowhere near estimated a daily commuter who uses the interstate im not heavy on the gas i estimate  mpg with octane	brand new  for a  bmw x nada resale max shows  at best i lost  in three years	i will never own another bmw  ill stick with lexus and acura
BMW,Engine/Performance,disappointment is the best compliment this car gets i have owned five bmws now including a   series convertible a   series a  z and now the x  i intentionally dropped down in size and class of car so i went in expecting some compromisesbut not what i have gotten  horribly cramped the auto engine cut off is terrible average gas mileage is  mpg worse than the lowest rating interior is flimsy and several plastic pieces fall out of their place regularly and worst of all my side airbags went of with no collision at all as i was taking a corner bmw dealer has told me this isnt the first time they have dealt with this  add to this the fact that the seats are horribly uncomfortable and i am beyond disappointed
BMW,Comfort/Interior,big disappointment after  new cadillacs and making the change to bmw in may i have been very disappointed first off when i drove the brakes had to be replaced with less than  milesthe onoff functionality is stupidwhen you park the car it shuts off except for the accessories and you have to turn it on and then off again which causes wear and tear per the manualand after  months apparently there was liquid spilled on the idrive which caused it to be replaced for the cost of unbelievable design to put an electronic idrive between  cup holders that cant withstand condensation from a cupcheap interior as wellnever again
BMW,Engine/Performance,edp x ordered car and picked up in munich as an edp car in junemajor optionsm package winter packagenice firm ride and soaks up bumps welldrove car  miles in germany austria and francetop speed driven was  mph on the autobahn  car was feeling floaty so did not go faster although the engine could handle itno issues in europe over  milesaveraged  to  mpgback in calif i have driven  miles and averaged from  to  mpg since being backi attribute the same mpg while driving much slower to the lower fuel quality ethanol
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,the good the bad and the ugly let me preface by saying my last three cars were hondas i wanted an upgrade with more pep and more luxury so here goes  the good acceleration  amazing interior space  amazing overall same length as my honda civic but the interior feels massive the technology package with bluetooth handsfree phone etc  great the steering  fantastic ok the bad  after two weeks the towhook cover in the front fell off never to be seen again rear visibility not great parking assist  i live in la and you really have to hurry your parking cause theres always someone behind you the parking assist is either slow in figuring out theres a spot or it never figures it out pointless fuel consumption  not great at all i have it on eco mode most of the time and my average after  miles with about  highway no traffic driving is  mpg the ugly the seats are terrible the ride is also terrible probably due to the runflat tires and maybe the suspension i started researching how to replace the seats and the tires yes its that bad
BMW,Comfort/Interior,the worst seats imaginable the good its faster than other similarly sized small suvs and has good bmw looksthe bad these are the worst seats my test drive seemed ok but once you sit in them for a while you know its like sitting on a flat park bench  sport seats are only available in the m package which dealers here dont order
BMW,Price/Value,x review buy price should be for invoice
BMW,Engine/Performance,wouldnt get another one got stuck in a lease with one of these i immediately regretted it bmw must be paying for positive reviews because it not that stellar of a vehicle the car has stylish looks has many bells and whistles and is fun to drive in sport mode but thats about it  everything else is like driving a typical cylinder kind of boring and sluggish the worst part about the x is the interior comfort and design the front seats are the worst ive ever seen they have zero padding way too firm like sitting on a park bench theyre also too narrow and high the leather is very grippy and not smooth tugs your shirt the steering wheel obstructs the dashboard you cant get a clear view of the entire instrumentation through the top hole of the steering wheel the controls for the screen and navigation are horrible and feel  years old selecting single letters or digits to input an address into the nav forget it its also unsafe having to look down at the control wheel and buttons instead of up i would not describe the whole system as intuitive at all outside temp only visible to the driver no digital speedometer annoying the onwheel radio controls are not the easiest to set up or navigate the whole cabin instrumentation is just overcomplicated and kind of frankensteined with new and old the screen looks like it should descend but it doesnt its kind of unsightly like its tacked on mpg is soso unless you drive in eco mode which turns engine off at stops overall very disappointed with the x it looks like a bmw on the outside but it isnt on the inside
BMW,Comfort/Interior,just not a good value ok small suv but noisy on the freeway  some cheap bits in the interior and harsh ride dealers are not willing to move of msrp much and its just not worth the purchase price poor value for the money
BMW,Engine/Performance,lives up to its vibe it truly is the ultimate driving machine that is the number one thing that hits and soothes you behind the wheel no other car drives or feels like this car does it does not matter if you want the performance or the pure luxury it delivers both
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,not happy number of things that bother me front door handles will pinch the fire out of your fingers if you are not careful after  miles the car only gets  mpg in dallas traffic   miles below what they say it should get not much of a pickup wheel base porpoises a lotupdate on    mpg is still crappy for this type of vehicle  plus what is reported by bmw  front door handles are poorly designed  will really pinch you if not careful  now have about  miles on automobile  would not buy one againjust had interesting experience on this vehicle on   had nail in left rear tire and it could not repaired found out that there are  run flat tires which cannot be repaired and you have to buy a new one   the bmw x uses pirelli and that is one of the   be sure before you buy to find if your run flats can be repaired  very importantupdate on   still not happy with gas mileage as advertised  yesterday it  for a tank of gasoline
BMW,Comfort/Interior,avoid the x i recently got into a  x and it was a huge mistake after test driving the car a few times i decided to transition from my i into an x as i was looking for more space and comfort after driving off the lot and sitting in the car for  minutes i immediately noticed the seat was off these are the most uncomfortable seats the drivers seat is now causing me back pain which ive had to visit a chiropractor to help manage unfortunately both the dealer and bmw corporate have not been helpful  they claim theres nothing they can do to help me i unfortunately will have to to exit my lease early and get into another make and model
BMW,Service/Maintenance,x  not a bmw take car out for a day drive
BMW,Design/Style,sexy and complicated confusing controls  complicated  not much visibility at the back
BMW,,x
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmw x have had our  x since middle of may  in less than  miles brakes failedagain the same problem at  miles seems short on power and acceleration not very pleased and hope to trade up very soon to an xwould not recommend this vehicle base on my experience
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,lacking have driven my x over  miles and still the fuel efficiency is only  max i drive only highways use the cruise control and the eco optionthe steering wheel feels heavy in comparison with my old saab that is a delight to drive but i will take a bunch of weight lifting classes with a personal trainer starting next week so this should help to drive no kidding  it is a heavy cow like it has no power assist maybe it does notthe car does not allow for a trailer mount to put a bike rack on the back the roof rack is hard to find yes thule apparently makes it but i ordered one at rei over a month ago and i am still waiting it looks nice in orange though
BMW,Comfort/Interior,one nice ride took this across the country  refined loaded interior is stock on the active hybrid so the price is not as bad as it looks if your looking for a loaded bmw  a pleasure to drive every time i get in it
BMW,Price/Value,car is not what i expected no value after sale
BMW,Engine/Performance,a pleasure to drive
BMW,Engine/Performance,bavaria rules i had several turbos incl the v twinturbo mbz but this new xm beats them all the suspension and insane acceleration supports speeds that can land you in the big house so one has to watch that head up display at all times the xm is obscenely fast and beats the cayenne turbo the ride feels safe at all times and the brakes are tops the standard drive setting offers a cultivated ride in rover style comfort whereas the car undergoes a major transformation in the sports mode or in the additional m mode this is where the fun is even the mufflers sound different and menacing then this is the st performance crossover suvcoupe on the road makes the rest look like shopping carts
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmw xm disappointment i purchased a new xm in february  from schomp bmw in highlands colorado  this car has had numerous problems including the airconditioning not working properly apple car play issues and finally brakes noise although i have gotten all of the other items corrected the brakes continue to be a unacceptable situation  my brakes on this xm sound like they are on a truck  the squeal most of the time when braking and vary in loudness most of the time unbearable  you cant drive with the windows down or the top open as the car sounds horrible  i have had it in at least  times for this problem  i have been told things like you have to dog the brakes to make them work right which is ridiculous and absurd  i have owned lots of high performance car corvettes porsches range rovers and mercedes  i expected more from bmw quality and service and have been sadly disappointed  for a product that i thought was top of the line in performance and excellence this has been a big disappointment
BMW,Design/Style,am i the only one i purchased a  i with k miles after an exhaustive look at other cars such as the audis mustangs and cameros  this was the comprimise between what i wanted audi a w  cyl and what my wife wanted camry  love driving it  drives wonderfully  quick steers well and is fun to play in  however ive only had the car for  months and it has already been in the shop more than any other car ive owned  every little thing seems to want to fail  since i bought it replaced the radionav still doesnt show traffic replaced rear shocks fixed the sunroof replaced the ac control unit fixedadjusted several different sensors and ninnies even as i type this i have it scheduled to return to the shop tomorrow to fix more issues  unfortunately depreciation is forcing me to keep it a while longer but im afraid that once the warranty is over next spring ill be on the hook with a nonstop list of fixes  maybe i got a bad one  i hope so as i love driving the thing and all of the reviews are positive relating to its reliability
BMW,Comfort/Interior,mxiinterior is a let down this is my th bmw  there are so many things that are just well thought  the door opening is awkward without a handle like other bmws have where your hand would naturally go  other controls are awkward and not very ergonomic  im quite disappointed in the interior of the car for a  car
BMW,Engine/Performance,performance chapel hill rules that once they drive it theyll be hooked
BMW,Engine/Performance,avoid water in your bmw i loved the car at  miles i drove thru a flooded  deep street  the car stopped and locked up  after getting towed to dealer on flatbed i was told the car had hydrolock the engine sucked in water the cost of new engine    why would bmw design an engine with the air intake  off the ground  doesnt it rain in germany  i am extremely disappointed and disgusted with this sad event why wasnt i told of the cars sensitivity to standing water  im done with bmw
BMW,Price/Value,no active safety whatsoever although bmw provides some of the active safety on other cars blind spot detection and surround cameras are not available on i convertible whatsoever in addition it hurts that bmw otherwise has it on other cars but not on this model the worst this for me was that bmw representatives assured me that the car will have all of these active safety options if driver assistance plus is ordered which came bundled with navigation system and premium package and which increases the price for additional  but it was not included
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmw certified program means well nothing i purchased a  bmw under a certified programÂ  i picked up the car and the service alarms were onÂ  i returned the car then the facia wasnt connected and some of the service was not doneÂ  then i finally got to drive the car and the engine was over  quarts low on oilÂ  i asked for a copy of the inspection report from the service manager nothingÂ  i contacted bmw usa nothingÂ  buyer bewareÂ  a certified bmw means nothing
BMW,Engine/Performance,severe problems in manual mode the  has what bmw calls an inherent characteristic  if you drive in manual shift mode the vehicle is prone to stuttering when coming to a stop  imagine your head bobbing back and forth like a doll on the dashboard  the vehicle is also prone to severe lunges when driving in m such as you might in a parking garage looking for  a spot or while moving forward in a metered freeway on ramp and to a lesser extent in automatic  the lunges are dangerous and you must drive defensively at  miles per hour  bmw states the problem is with the  softwareit thinks the engine is stalling and the computer gives the engine throttle bmw wont fix the problem  stay away from this vehicle
BMW,Comfort/Interior,you will not be disappointed went for a drive in the country last weekend and all i can say is wow car was rock solid at  and when passing a car it was still pushing me back in the seat at  has all the torque you would ever need soft leather seats and a well laid out interior the exhaust rumble make you want to drive it this car is a keeper
BMW,Comfort/Interior,rear suspention problems overall is a great car dont get me wrong im been an bmw enthusiast for years but the dealer cant fix the wear of the rear tires on the inside they want me to do alignment and put new set of tires at  miles at my expense thats the reason i purchased a  car on the first place insane
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmw i overrated the bmw i is not what i expected this is not a sports car it is an overpriced  sporty sedan  the manual transmission is awful  the navigation system is worse the car handles well for a sedan  acceleration from zero is not great but it does have a great deal of power from  mph to  mph
BMW,Engine/Performance,over rated this is not a sports car  it is a sporty twosedan    the manual transmission is very disappointing the car corners well but is not very quick  mpg  however it does well getting on the freeway mph it does not compare very favorably to a  porsche but it competes well with the sl  mercedes
BMW,Comfort/Interior, ci has no equal in the market smg makes the car hard to drive smoothly active steering feels awkward and unnatural otherwise the car is a terrific driver i can live with the idrive i think there is a little dodge stratus in the back it makes the car look cheap honestly i never quite got used to the awful trunk the car seems confused on whether to ape porsche or dodgethe front is unique not really attractive but not particularly ugly either saddle up behind the seat and the outside wont matter any more
BMW,Service/Maintenance,in for service over  days in shop in  months
BMW,Engine/Performance,"ci i waited a year for this car  overall the vehicle is unbelievable  i get an adrenaline rush every time at a stoplight"
BMW,Design/Style,"sun roof less this was always my dream car but a major draw back for a coupe that cost k the so called moon roof  sun roof opens only  inches as a ventpoor design also extremely tight in rear sit"
BMW,Engine/Performance,beauty in motion a blast to drive  cant leave it in the garage and take the lexus
BMW,Design/Style,"a dream machine this could be the neatest car ive ever owned and that includes a corvette an xke and  years of mercedes s class  this is a blast to drive and a show stopper  a sports car with room for four if you need it a plus over an xk and quicker than a cat  the design and airflow keep you and passangers from being wind blown"
BMW,Service/Maintenance,disappointing my i was the worst car i ever owned the computer system went out causing the vehicle to malfunction they replaced it the windows would not go up in the rain they tried to fix it but continued to be a problem the navigation system is the worst i got tired of all the problems and traded it in at  miles while driving it to the chevy dealership to trade it in the computer system went blank and  at a time all the systems went black absolutely the worst car i have ever owned
BMW,Engine/Performance,"great idea poor implementation this is an exquisite car in form and powertrain but it is frstratingly poor in terms of enjoyment and ride quality the throttle is too long in regular driving but too responsive while in sport mode the idrive is the single most foolhardy idea that bmw has ever incorperated it distracts the drver cannot be used during travel and detracts from the driving experience leaving you frustrated and unfulfilled the driver is very isolated from the road again leaving me unhappy and frustrated with the car i personally regret my purchase of this particular automobile and hope that bmw corrects the problems with this car before it ruins thier previously infallible comapny"
BMW,Service/Maintenance,the great hype just bought this car this past august  ive seriously have driven the car no more than two weeks  this car is already a nightmare  gasket leaks and misfiring issues should have stuck with mercedes bmw dealer cant even pin point the issue  very poor customer service bmw of peabody ma stinks im ready to throw in the towel at this point
BMW,Engine/Performance,love the car  hate the headaches reliability is an issue right now i need to take the car to the shop to get the engine gaskets replaced the intermittent pdc failure analyzed the trunk lock sensor fixed so that i can open it with the remote the brake fluid flushed the interior filter replaced brake pads replaced etc
BMW,Design/Style,wheeee doggy since  the only car me and my wife ever drove was the  series there never was another car for us but got tired of waiting for the new on order  decided to try something new wow
BMW,Design/Style,idrive systems   the  cic is a fun car to drive it handles with excellence and attracts the nice car symbol with the thumbs up everywhere i go what i am disappointed with is the malfunction of the i drive system resetting itself or freezing my roll bar protection for some reason has deactivated itself i made an appointment on january rd to take my car in and unfortunately the next available date is the th of february very disappointing for a k car
BMW,Service/Maintenance,bmw  bummer you already know you have overdone it with the electronics i have  miles on this car and it has been in to the dealership  times already i cant wait for the lease to expire so i can buy a porsche thank god i leased this car and do not own it get the idea im frustrated all the problems have been computer related
BMW,Price/Value,ultimate experince insurance cost
BMW,Design/Style,away with the ipod this is a wonderful automobile except for two very annoying things  the ipod control knob is a disaster it requires unsafe driver attention to use and is a dangerous distraction if used while moving  the stereo system turns on each time you start the car this is very annoying
BMW,Design/Style,black beauty review
BMW,Service/Maintenance,stealth my only complaint really is ease of access entry and exit the front seats the lumbar sticks out too much and one has to twist to get in or out and it isnt not great on a problematic back
BMW,Price/Value,worst nightmare i purchased a  bmw x i for k on the first week of purchased problems started and every week after until ever  months i now have this vehicle for a year and have spent k out of pocket trying to fixed it thats does not include additional k thats warranty paid and just found out it has another problem which cost k to fixed this car has cost me nothing but pain and stress i have not driven this vehicle for months without not going into the shop i literally cry dealing with this piece of cabbage i would advice ppl to stay away formit i no long need this car because its nothing but problems and still has to pay the bank monthly am stuck with a hefty loan and the car is of know use to me
BMW,Comfort/Interior,very disappointed  definitely not worth the money i purchased a used  bmw x less than  year agothis is my first luxury vehicle  ive always heard great reviews about bmw within my first year of ownership i have spent numerous hours in the bmw service department having major repairs done to this vehiclethey have replaced the transmission the radiator solenoid valve twice latch on rd seat broke off completely brake fluid flush and im heading back into the service department this week bcuz the cel is on again for the rd time in  weeksim extremely disappointed  would not recommend this vehicle or any bmw for purchasenot the quality that i thought i was getting for my money
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,no major complaints purchased car brand new  expected lots of issues especially when i was reading reviews  to my surprise  pretty reliable only had to replace battery because of a bad cell could happen in any car
BMW,Service/Maintenance,worst suv in history run from this suv mine has been in the shop over  months two dead tow ins and two dead battery caused by electrical flaws poor customer support  it is march  and last time i drove it was feb th been at dealer no end in sight  now i have to sue them as they accept no responsibility for  get a good reliable auto not this
BMW,Comfort/Interior,bmw never again bought the car with sport package including  wheels wished ive known then what i know now replace the rims several times each or  to fixonce  were crack at the same time if i run over a pothole for sure  rim will crack in the city its hard to avoid potholes when traffic is too close behind those rims have run flat tiresso no sparesno car until new rims arriveabout days now there is a problem with the batteryit gets awaken for no reasonwhich means battery is deadso key is stucknothing workshad the car jumped and running would not get into gear pick up car today weekleft window was open during rainleft door  seat controls soaked including leather seat
BMW,Engine/Performance,im saying goodbye to bmw after  years my  x has been nothing but a nightmare and the worse vehicle i have ever owned ive owned many new bmws   and two  series but my x is a completely different experience it is a loser a huge disappointment in terms of quality control problems but the worse part is how bmw has handled the issue  which is very poorly x was in for recurring service issues  months in st  years for a series of false engine warning lights ele issues rear hatch door problems and cosmoline that drips onto glasspaint no support from bmw had to retain attorney as bmw na could care less bmw na execs clearly more concerned with their stock options than long term customers  bye bye bmw
BMW,Service/Maintenance, x transmission issues beware the  bmw x redesigned  model has major flaws with the transmission  bmw has admitted to the issue and does not have a fix therefore recalls have not been sent out a k car should not have a major fault  the car runs sluggish especially going up hills  it has a hard time shifting into the correct gear  the x does not accelerate well from a stopped position and it feels as if it is going to stall before it recognizes you are trying to accelerate  in the past  months my car has been in for service x times for a week at a time  i have been in contact with bmw north america at this point  beware
BMW,Service/Maintenance,parking brake malfunction i have owned the x for only a year and twice now i encountered a parking brake malfunction the first time this happened was on thanksgiving day had to get the suv towed from the gas station manual hand brake feature would not work just today just went to buy groceries and the parking brake malfunction went on again had to wait for tow truck for over hrs no other options but to have suv towed very inconvenient and have to wait until monday for dealership to open even more inconvenient other than this had to change  tires twice due to nail punctures run flats cannot be patched spent over  changed one tire suv not even a month old not safe for long drives do not buy
BMW,Engine/Performance, x  problematic my first bmw and my last at k one would expect greater reliability the cabin has been filled with squeaks and rattles even the headrest squeaks the dashboard has been taken apart twice consistent major malfunctions abs awd hill descent cruise have shut down  times in less than a year wout warning running boards are useless makes it difficult for entering exiting vehicle the  lags at low speeds always needing to shift into sport mode the ride over uneven road surfaces is punishing steering is very stiff always need  hands at low speeds no available option for a remote start due to the complex wiring the quality material  of the sunvisors is poor not even a place for sunglass
BMW,Engine/Performance,poorly made  plastic and cheap this new bmw x is a shocker  the suvsav is so cheaply made on the interior that it buzzes and rattles over all roads  my year old insisted that the back seats felt like sitting in the plastic bleachers at a school ball game  i like bmw and im shocked that this car ever left the test facility  its all engine and suspension and performs well but the build quality is cheap  the leather seating surfaces are hard and felt like vinyl
BMW,Service/Maintenance,not so great this is my rd x and was i thought a no brainer to purchase wrong part of my disappointment may come from the fact that my previous xs were s this car feels underpowered  and slow in many situations the seats are very different from my old x i have yet to find a comfortable setting have driven  miles so far   the x has changed its size slightly but enough that it is difficult for a short person to enter my runflat got a flat at  and they would not fix it only replace it for  car has had some computer glitches got towed away dead at  dealership never could figure it out the info screen goes dead sometimes for no reason not a great bmw
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,its a machine been driving the bmw x  for three
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmw x the bmw x is an unbelievable car the
BMW,Engine/Performance,watch out for trans problems nothing but mehanical problems since i
BMW,Comfort/Interior,go get something else terrible technology  my third bmw x    model is very disappointing   no technology compared to competition can name a few better comparison   range rover mercedes gl series  lexus    interior is very cheap no massage setting on x k vechile  very disappointed   please do a recall to do an interior redesign
BMW,Comfort/Interior,owner a lot of rubber noise on the road
BMW,Comfort/Interior,great driving poor spacer if want cargo area for suv very disappointing previous model much better
BMW,Engine/Performance,dont buy the  bmw x junk junk junk i dont know if bmw is still making the x maybe they corrected the problems but i know their customer service sucks they will not address the problems with the transmission shifting on its own on flat land going up a hill is cool going down and hell put it in neutral but im flat land is going to shift rd to nd th the nd rd to nd th second drives you crazy surprised the engine didnt explode in the one of the engine leaks oil everywhere
BMW,Price/Value,drive train ok but pos vehicle on top of it drive train is good but extremely expensive to maintain and has some very poor engineering designs  accessories are low quality high rate of failure and expensive  the electronics  have the worst programing logic and a high rate of failure  it would be passible if you could put a real vehicle on top of the drive train  spent a lot of money for nothing
BMW,Service/Maintenance,dont buy x  maintenance nightmare have spent over  replacing transfer case belts pumps cooling fan assembly battery pulley
BMW,Engine/Performance,mixed review bought used with  miles  loved appearance inside and out  immediately noted the amfm reception in northern minnesota was the worst of my experience with over  vehicles  dealer denied there was a problem in  visits finally told me  of owners dont listen to am anyways  communications with corporate bmw were very poor  the person in nj was experienced at deflecting complaints but knew little about cars twice had engine problems under warranty where car blew black smoke out of exhaust now at  the dash displays are missing some digits and the fix is too expensive  one key fob is dead and you cant fix yourself wheels are corroded dealer experience has been poor
BMW,Service/Maintenance,bad vehicle since i purchased this car it has had nothing but problems the car has spent more time in the shop than in my garage every week is something wrong with this car i have spent over k in repairs and thats not including what the extended warranty company has paid i am very disappointed in bmw this car is not the ultimate machine they make it to be
BMW,Engine/Performance,mixed bag performance appearance gas mileage are all excellent the interior trim is not holding up and the controls are terrible  am radio reception is terrible and the controls on the steering wheel are much too complicated in comparison to the mercedes and honda i drive  cruise control has  buttons with symbols and must be actuated whenever you start the vehicle  the sound system has no dial to go from stations only a button to advance  i would never buy another bmw  ill stick to mercedes and hondas  this is a fun to drive ride and it is a shame they let the little things get in the way of satisfaction for people like me
BMW,Engine/Performance,x  fun to drive very fast living in boston where it is full of annoying potholes it is tough on the suspension year round toyo prox tires are the way to go i am getting bored now so i am purchasing some dinan products to enhance performance and sound
BMW,Engine/Performance, x has been extremely reliable with
BMW,Engine/Performance, bmw x  what a highway cruiser  so quiet
BMW,Price/Value,incredibly expensive to maintain the v biturbo constantly requiring expensive maintenance bought with k miles in  have spend   and this it at least  less than what the dealer would charge everything requires massive labor and parts are amazingly expensive my th bmw but my first v biturbo
BMW,Engine/Performance,not for family high tech high performance and safe and overal uncomfortable sporty and rough drive and very hard steering
BMW,Engine/Performance, year bmw x experience let me provide you with the list of problems i faced one after the other dashboard failed within  monthsstate inspection failed within  months tires gone and no support from bmw very poor customer care door from driver side failed wouldnt work with keyless entry here comes the worst one engine malfunction god saved my life on a highway where my x suddenly gave this error message on dashboard screen and stopped suddenly on highway where  big trailers were just behind me very scarey  low battery message in just  months
BMW,Price/Value,bmw does not protect electronics from melted snow or grocery spills in the cargo area do not let the bmw perception for reliability deceive you common place expectations for simple engineering rigor to protect consumers from costly repairs due to liquid damage is not a part of the bmw reputation if you are considering purchasing a bmw think twice the marketing team was responsible for the final decision not to repair over  in damage due to electronics placed along the drip path for liquid spills in the rear cargo area of the xd the electronic connectors were placed in a position so that the cup is turned in a way to catch liquids there are no protective nor preventative measures to prevent liquids from entering and destroying critical expensive electronics
BMW,Service/Maintenance,a keeper you may be disappointed with dealer trade in valuation
BMW,Engine/Performance,a tank with style and performance i have a  d sport which has covered
BMW,Service/Maintenance,my last bmw which is unfortunate since this is the th bmw ive ownednow my lastpurchased this x certified preowned which basically amounts to at least being able to drive around in a newer model bmw just about every month for the numerous times i had my x in the shopliterally a week after purchase it was in service bought from an authorized bmw dealernot that that means anything nowadaysso far replacedtransmission alternator rear lights roof trim electronic dash panorama sunroof fixed not replaced xenon headlampthe worst part is that it takes three visits for every one issuenever done right the first timeohand bmw charges  a pop for cpo repairs
BMW,Comfort/Interior,lemon x is this is my third bmw and i would not go for bmw again sometime the back door locks wont open and we cannot open the back door from inside or outside kids can be trap inside the car unless they climb to the front seat the steering wheel get stiff from time to time self leveling light is always on in the winter the lock freeze easily thus impossible to open or close the motor rattles too much on a cold days i went to the dealers many times and they have no clue what is going on the computer cant pick anything up this is a  k truck and it made like crap i certainly wouldnt try another bmw again all german car dont seem to know how to design electronic properly
BMW,Comfort/Interior,i will never buy another bmw  i bought mine certified preowned which ive come to find out means nothing i had always dreamed of a luxury car and was thrilled to drive off the lot with it since then i have been so disappointed  constant problems with the nav warning lights coming on lighter fuse busting blutooth issues and worst of all when i accidentally locked my keys in the car w my dog inside bmw roadside assistance told me that it was highly unlikely that the locksmith could open it this happens a lot they said and that i would have to wait  hrs for a key to be made or just break the window  well oviously had to break the window  it was  to fix  im over bmw ps replacement keys are
BMW,Design/Style,never again creature comforts are very nice and fun to drive but horribly unreliable at  miles started to sound like a diesel alternator bearings bad and then completely failed cheap oem crimp style hose clamp on transmission recovery bottle failed which is also positioned directly above alternatordealer service technicians incorrectly diagnosed as having a bad high pressure power steering hosefound out they wanted  for repair and i towed it back home to fix myself for eats break pads and rotors for lunchrepld with better aftermarketbrake pad sensor is poor design and you must replace sensor at pad change or your brake pad warning light will stay illuminated
BMW,Engine/Performance,junk i had a dodge durango  before this x and never had a problem with it the x is the worst car i had  it leaks from the roof when it rains took it back to the dealer to get it fixed so many times and still same problem electrical problem goes dead cant find the problem driver door wont open from outside with this car you never know if the engine is going to start or not you dont expect this from a bmw i am about to put a sign on my glass saying dont buy this car too many problems
BMW,Service/Maintenance,very bad bmw from day one this vehicle was a major disapointment  spent almost k on vehicle that went through brakes every  miles after the first service  was in dealership almost every  weeks very noisy and very poor in snow  most dissapointing was dealer response  said i must be driving with two feet  have two other  series with a total of  miles on them and no brake problems  dealer has refused to honor warranty after only  miles
BMW,Design/Style,its outta here had a  acura mdx prior to this bmw x loved the mdx but it was approaching  miles didnt want to wait for redesigned mdx bought the x only good thing i can say is it has a sporty handling with zip other than this i am extremely disappointed in the vehicle it is poorly built and in the  months owned has been into the shop x for electrical problem that they cant seem to find what is causing vehicle to go dead i would never buy another bmw and when this one gets out of the shop in next day or so will look to get rid of probably go back to mdx as my son has my old one  miles and running while my bmw is broke down with  miles
BMW,Comfort/Interior,not what i expected from a bmw i have just about  miles on my x  not aerodynamically designed if it is windy and im traveling faster than  miles there is a whistling noise coming from the front of the windshield  the luggage compartment cover is also rather annoying due to its rattling  this is not what i had expected from a bmw
BMW,Comfort/Interior,bmw x with rd seatings my is base on this automobile is the luxury it provide from family size
BMW,Comfort/Interior,reliable dog car
BMW,Price/Value,shoulda remembered not to buy euro car w kmiles the reason being is you dont know how it was treated and boy has this car been costly worst car ive ever owned in terms of reliability not worth the privilegepride of but its a bmw seems theres  kinds of reviews here crummy car  i love it but its expensive to maintain wait till you get more miles on it bought used at k miles and in  months we were movingdriving from seattle to az wed had it checked before the move  i asked the mechanic is summer heat in the desert a factor with reliability at all he chuckled at the question  paid  to check car  replace oil cooler seal  filter stand gasket   miles into the moving trip the transmission slipped  did so  times on trip to az over k repairs for this  replacing the catalytic converter and the mechanics said  it desperately needed a system update which had it in the shop an extra  days  the usb port went out right away the ac is kind of annoying because you never feel the left drivers side vent on you unless its blasting  months later  the water pump went out at k miles along with  thermostat assembly   the suspension needed work signal by one of many times warning light come on about  if you worship a car  devote much money to it this is the car for you
BMW,Engine/Performance,worst car ive ever owned worst car ive ever owned  i had this car for  year   month    the st month i owned my car i had to fix the thermostat  water pump   then after that month the wiper motor went  ive never been able to truly drive my car any long distance for fear of it breaking down  ive replaced the sparks plugs and all the cylinders because the car would spit  sputter  shake  my engine light constantly comes on  now i know why changed owners so many times  biggest piece of crap
BMW,Price/Value,"love the x but lots of serious issues so ive had  bmws in the past  years and overall really love the brand  unfortunately the purchase of my x has tarnished my otherwise positive view of build quality    generally i lease vehicles but this i chose to purchase with the idea of keeping it for   years figuring i could justify the  price if amortized over those years   the x has a lot of complex things about it so i wasnt foolish to think it would be a low maintenance vehicle  but didnt expect   at k miles  new ac   new rear struts   now  a new transmission  seriously at k miles this is a disgrace    my pampered x has sadly failed me summary  extended warranty"
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,water pump fail we bought an  x  cyl in oct w a little over k miles had it serviced while still under warranty cracked airintake boot replaced faulty left mirror adj switch replaced oilgasket leak repaired  new brake pads  sensors replaced on all   all warranty work then in jan the elec water pump failed causing eng overheat  the car automatically forced my wife to slow down this in itself to me is quite dangerous depending on what sort of traffic one might be in when this occurs at the time the car had just past k miles by  miles we still got a free tow under warranty  bmw did pay for the water pump part but not the pricy labor involved this is our st bmw
BMW,Price/Value,what did bmw do to the quality  wow  i had a  x that was the best car i ever ownedbut when i bought into this piece of plastic crap very poor qualiyt all the way aroundwhat did they to what was a mastered car i cant wait to trade back to an  no power poor sound systemand a flawed i drivei have a  cy but the car thinks its a v verypoor on gasi will cost me  k loss but i will be back to an    and if you have an   hang on to it my lastone had over kand ran like new when i made my fatal mistake k mistake
BMW,Price/Value,extremely poor build quality extremely poor build quality it rattles and squeaks intermittent suspension noises which dealers cannot fix purchased brand new in  and hardly used please stay away from bmw buy a toyota spend the rest of the money with your family dont make the mistake i made
BMW,Service/Maintenance,disappointment beginning may th  the battery went dead  times always when i needed it most until nov th   the service dept was no help at all  they actually had the salesman deliver it to us on saturday night nov th saying it was our problem  it was our rd x  wed had with no trouble with the others but i fixed the problem myself by buying a mercedes gl  bye bye bmw
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,avoid this vehicle bought brand new june   two months later the motor on the ac blower failed  three months after that the fuel pump failed and left me stranded on a busy highway  six months later the transmission failed while on a family vacation  bmw highway assistance is worthless  you get put on hold for  minutes if they answer at all then are told they can send a tow truck within   hours  overall a disappointing experience for an expensive vehicle
BMW,Engine/Performance,dont buy bmw x this suv handles like truck and rides like truck in regular road i took it to off road recently i wish i could return it it was worst riding than  wheelers  in  months ac motor had to be replace  back up light at night is so bad you can not see the curb try it  you need to continually give gas to go forward or it will drastically slow down  now motor sit adjusting on the drive side makes noise  so on it is just bad suv
BMW,Engine/Performance,schizophrenic transmission transmission shift points unpredictable hangs in lower gears sometimes have to upshift manually  also run flat tires are awful  problem with parking brake locking up will not release by electronic control had to release by manual method in truck compartment  royal pain in the rain this morning  good luck
BMW,Engine/Performance,disappointed i have had my x fully loaded for less than  months  i have had it towed x and will be taking it in to the dealer again this week because i cant use my bluetooth or bmw assist  i can hear them but they cant hear me  additionally i dont think i have the power i should  my last vehicle was a loaded i i expected the same performance and do not get it yes i realize it is a heavier vehicle but supposedly adjustments have been made for power i dont have the confidence to pass when immediate acceleration is required because of potential lag  i want to love my car this is a purchase not a lease  given the cost of this vehicle i am kicking myself
BMW,Engine/Performance,disappointing start with my x has only  miles in it at  miles engine light came per mechanic something wrong with catalytic converter failed fan just recently while traveling in freeway a small rock or pebble hit my front panel creating a quarter sized hole side panel just behind headlight is made with composite or some kind of plastic
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,mechanical nightmare i purchased this car with k miles and have had it  years  it is a great car to drive and has tons of power downside a mechanical nightmare i had to have new brakes and rotors at k miles  had the cooling expansion tank replaced both power window motors replaced door lock cylinder replaced water pump replaced as well as all hoses and belts since they had it apart  also had a bad tail light piece replaced and one cv boot on the front axle replaced  it also wears tires out very quickly because of the negative camber that bmw installs on these things  worst car i have ever owned mechanically
BMW,Price/Value,good but not great i have this x with sport package as a compromise between owning a fast sedan and owning a practical family car  i save on insurance in ma by not having two cars  i have not been disappointed  it will go well over  mph when i want and it tows the boat to the cottage a couple times a summer too
BMW,Design/Style,exceeded my expectations i bought my  v as a certified pre owned it was a prior demo with k miles on it now i have k with nary a problem change the oil fill it with gas and go and this baby goes it handles just like a sports car it is solid and tight still has the new smell in it from the ultra luxurious leather i opted for one without the sports package the ride still is a little on the stiff side but has everything else everything looks and works perfectevery time i detail it the car looks and feels like a brand new car there is a lot to be said for bmw build quality and enginering i still have the original tires and changed the brakes only once at k miles unbelievable for a  lb car
BMW,Service/Maintenance,beware the electronics demons i have been a bmw buyers for over
BMW,Price/Value,"good perfermance poor durability i bought this car new and it was great until the k mile warranty expired thats when onboard computer readout started to go bad just the start of one big headache the resale is awful on this car also car had a noise that the dealer was never able to fix goes thru the oil fast maybe i just got a lemon"

BMW,Mileage/Fuel,not what ive expected when i bought this car i was so excited till the driver door handle started giving problem it will not open from outside this was a continuous problem  every time we had to drive about  miles to get it fix and after  months we were back to the same problem this is a fun car in the summer but comes winter and it becomes terrible even with winter tires lots of electrical problem  tail lights were always going off no more am i going to buy a bmw x
BMW,Price/Value,horrible experience ive only had it for  months ive had the car for about  months and ive experienced all types of problems  both the driver and passenger doors have problems with the handles the passenger door doesnt open from the outside and the driver door doesnt open from the inside the stabilizing system is ridiculously expensive to fix about  depending on where you live when shifting gears you can hear loud rattling sounds dont buy this car
BMW,Engine/Performance,stay away stay far away we bought this as an alternative to our minivan thinking we would get the same quality from the x as our other bmws from the start we had problems within the first  months we replaced the oxygen sensor max air flow regulator thermostat and lower control arms along with what seemed like a half dozen sensors that keep going bad even the general maintenance costs are very high as its costs  for an oil change  quarts premium synthetic and  octane gas performance brakes  tires etc we ended up selling this and taking a loss back in college i had a  i and later a  i convertible that were both extremely reliable what happened bmw
BMW,, bmw x tmv ftom
BMW,Comfort/Interior,horrible quality and workmanship we bought this used from a private party who was the second owner all the maintenance and repairs were done by the dealership it was welled cared for all i can say from day  it is a lemon  we got for k less than private party price but it is a lemon  the interior design is great but the quality of items door handlessun shadesback tailgateetc feels like the cheap made in china toys that break the same day you open it  this is our second bmw and thought it would be the same quality our  i has never had any problems just routine  synthetic oil changes and normal brake replacements  the x is horrible do not buy one  i should have just bought me a new odyssey
BMW,Design/Style,disappointed  months after purchase driver power window failed to operate i was told poor design  broke again then pass  side front failed then pass rear failed  charged for last three  at  miles right tail lights quit  bad socket  both front axles failed replaced  self leveling system failed  total cost over  usd  at  ignition coil failed  this car has never been off road  regularly serviced and garage kept  currently at  miles have cooling problem   i think blown intake gasket  and  maybe  more coils driver window will not close again  front fan inop  and many dash digits out  i say never buy st model year not even a bmw  no to bmw of sa  i have a lemon
BMW,Engine/Performance,the worst suv you will ever buy i bought this suv loved the design and it is a fun suv to drive although the car is horrible it has been in the shop for countless issueswhich are major  water pump went out had to be towed radiator went out  numerous sensors that wont go off even after going to the shop for repair engine misses at low speeds the car is very unreliable and i do not feel safe driving it i will never own another bmw ever too costly and not enough reliability constant headache of whats going to happen next i have a huge folder of all its repairsthat is ridiculous considering what i paid for it i am selling it tomorrow hopefully the warning lights will stay off until then dont buy
BMW,Engine/Performance,fun to drive yes plenty of problems yes bought this car new in  put about k miles a year on it  highwaylocal great car to drive but nothing but problems  windows stick doors freeze in cold weather try driving with your left hand holding the door closed because it wont lock or try getting in on the passenger side and climbing over into the drivers seat then theres the engine  twice in very cold weather something went wrong with the oil exchangervalve car makes loud noise then plumes of black smoke emerge from the exhaust dash  front grille the first time bmw took care of it out of warranty  this time were waiting to hear should be a recall item
BMW,Price/Value,x review this vehicle will do anything that a
BMW,Comfort/Interior,x i i have had the x for  months and the
BMW,Service/Maintenance,"electrical gremlins our   x is the ultimate driving machine  we love everything about it except  it has electrical gremlins in it  the dash warning lights come on and off all the time indicating the need to check rear and brake lights  we take it to the dealership they replace what is broken if the check lights are actually still on when we get to the dealership and we go home some time a few days later it happens again check rear lights etc   consumer reports rates the s electrical system very poor  newer models are much improved"
BMW,Comfort/Interior,"awesome suv but quality sucks dear bmw please build your next x line with two major changes  do something about the terrible build quality  i have owned mine for almost  years now and its been in the shop about once every  months or more often the whole time  the worst incident was when it took your dealerships repair folks three separate attempts to fix my leaking radiator expansion tank and i may be about to make a th trip to get it fixed again  make the damn thing  inches longer and put all the extra space in the cargo area and btw offer a rd row seat while youre at it"
BMW,Service/Maintenance,worst car or truck i have ever owned i have owned  different s and bought the suv for my wife because she wanted a suvi have had good luck with my other bmws but this x was the worst thing i have ever owned it does have power and does drive more like a sports car then a suv but the thing was the worst built car i have ever owned everything that could go wrong hasi had a few friends that worked at the dealership and they told me they are junk but i already had purchased it and was stuck with it after i started having problems i did some googleing and found tht everyone has the same problems i amabout to post it on craigslist for parts i will never own another bmw crappy service too
BMW,Engine/Performance,x another dream machine its a dream to drive whether its cross
BMW,Service/Maintenance,"looking for another brand next time many small things have gone wrong or broken in the vehicle which meant many trips to the dealer to have them repaired there were two major recalls one regarding faulty acceleration i almost gone plowed over by a tactor trailer when the truck did not accelerate through an intersection the other for the braking system  not a very pleasnt bmw experience for me and i was a tried and true customer this was my third bmw  i am looking at other brands for my next suv  check carefully the cars history if you buy one used"
BMW,Engine/Performance,terrible never buy i recently bought this car engine service soon light make me crazy spend more than still light oncrazy maintenance cost never recommend
BMW,Comfort/Interior,do not buy bmw x is an excellent suv when its new  when it gets older its got all sorts of problems both big and small  avoid this vehicle  problems include cooling system leak and airbag sensor below drivers seat that failed and which may or may not prevent airbag from deploying during accident  repairs are very expensive
BMW,Service/Maintenance,unreliable and horrific repair costs i certainly get the fun to drive and german engineering concept  it is  other than that the experience has been nothing short of pathetic  i just dont know how bmw can build a car this poorly  read the blogs because there is so much common ground with what you can expect  fan clutch gasket failure window regulators taillight failure door handles  etc  it just never stops  to make matters worse bmw built this car for  years and never addressed these problems  i will never take this car on a trip for fear that ill be stranded and stuck paying thousands to get it running  cant wait to unload it bad company and bad car  dont buy
BMW,Comfort/Interior,my third bmw and still loving them i have not found another vehicle that matches the bmw standards and driving comfort i have driven vehicles from most brand names on the market i have compared all features with a lot of disappointments i still have found very little disappointment in bmw those that complain have to completed there homework once you drive one its hard to drive anything else
BMW,Engine/Performance,wish i can return it its my first bmw i was excited at first to drive it but when it reached its  miles it gave me a lot of trouble engine wouldnt start at all dealer changed the alternator and battery every time i drive this car im nervous because it might cause trouble again no doubt it happened again today after  months with  miles the car stop at the road during winter time while im driving unable to start it tried multiple times battery is totally dead and it has to be towed again in the dealership this is my only car and i used it for work im totally upset about its inconvenience i wish i can return this car to bmw its a lemon car
BMW,Design/Style,not too bad but would not buy again well i decided to write my review after owning the vehicle for  years  it is a lease and we are due to turn it in in  days  so here goes  first my likes  this is my rd bmw and of all the bmws ive owned i have to say this one has been the most reliable  we have had virtually no issues at all with the car unlike my last bmws  the only real problem we have had with the car in the  years is that the drivers side exterior mirror glass is tarnishing badly and needs to get replaced      things i dont like  let me tell you if you have kids do not buy this car  it is way too small and short wheelbased for a comfortable family car  rides too stiff and seats too hard
BMW,Price/Value,is this really a bmw this  x was a replacement for a lemon  of exact color type and equipmenti think they just swapped plates on the vehicle the  had a bad transmission and sunroof both of which were finally replaced after five months of disgusting arguments the  still had the same problems those being transmission that didnt know what gear it wanted to be in and a sunroof that leaked and would not close as it was designed to i have owned seven bmws and generally thought they were some of the best cars built this was also my third x but definitely my last i could go on and on with the problems but there is not enough room in this review stay away from this vehicle it is not worth it
BMW,Engine/Performance,ive been had i was seduced by its good looks and big engine our x has been a maintenance nightmare something very expensive fails on this vehicle about once every  months out of warranty fixes has cost us about  per year since owning it the latest news is it failed to pass smog due to value leaks my bmw tech told me this is common for this engine well now i have to spend another k  in parts  hours of labor to replace the value seals just to get it to pass smog this is my second and last bmw
BMW,Price/Value,biggest bucket of worms ive ever owned bought the car with the extended warranty started out having to replace the bulbs of the headlights several times the run flat tires are expensive no spare the computer display will display the message that you have a flat and to pull over or drive for  miles if you have runflats however the computer will not allow you to exit this screen and switch to navigation was on a trip in canada when i had a flat and had no idea which would be the closest city battery drains in a heart beat if you open and close the back hatch several times while packing for a trip need a big truck to give you a jump had to replace battery twice within the first  years the plastic components like inside driver door handle and steering wheel spokes are crap the have a thin colored plastic coating on it that bubbles up and peels off was told it is the acid in my skin  first car ever that was allergic to me on aug i had the routine maintenance done the warranty ran out aug but i only had  miles on the car on aug i break down on the side of the road with a trunk full of perishable groceries had to have it towed to dealership  miles away electronic water pump and thermostat needed to be replaced  picked up the car the next week and on the drive home the ac went out they picked up the car the next day and it needed a new compressor at  received the car two days later and now the passenger side electric mirror control is messed up run honey run
BMW,Engine/Performance,disappointed it seemed promising at first but after a few months im done with it there are more rattles than an old volvo the  is weak idrive is useless the run flats are crazy expensive and have no traction in snow and it rides worse than my f x actually my f is built better more dependable has equal handling and performance and gets about the same gas mileage now the evaporator is leaking freon maybe this rd trip in the dealer can resolve these issues
BMW,Engine/Performance,fed up of inconsistent diagnostics my bmw is under  months old with less than  miles and has been back to the dealer for the same problem it has an annoying vibrating sound from the engine the dealer changed the power steering pump and problem still exists now i am told it might be an engine mount i would like to return this truck because i am fed up of the inconsistency of what a new car should have i should have kept my infinti qx
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,marginal vehicle the diesel is sluggish during initial acceleration and does not yield the fuel mileage suggested  purchased predriven  bmw corp vehicle from the dealership that did not disclose appearance and functional issues at the time of sale the dealer will not cooperatively correct these flaws
BMW,Price/Value,not again i wouldnt buy another
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,no southern comfort i leased this  x for my wife i have never leased a car before but i am glad i did since i will be getting rid of this vehicle asap the car is a gas guzzler and you are constantly filling up it is just outright inconvenient the fuel tank is just too small the backup sensor system so sensitive that it is obnoxious the air conditioning system is inadequate and very noisy the left side of the drivers face is always hot during sc summer months as the ac airflow is entirely inadequate run flat tires seem good until you have a flat or blowout then you must depend on bmw roadside service which is useless on the weekends very disappointed in this vehicle for the price of the lease
BMW,Comfort/Interior,not worth the hype if there is any i should have waited  interior is still boring nav is still a pain gas mileage is much worse than posted turning radius is one of the worst in its midsize suv class and there is so much more to dislike
BMW,Engine/Performance,x d nightmare my  x diesel such a nightmare shame on bmw
BMW,Engine/Performance,x d twin turbo  nuf said i commute  miles a day so i need a car with both fuel economy and an exciting driving experience  my commute has gone from a total drag to something i actually look forward to  the lbs of torque plaster me to the drivers seat and the responsive steering makes maneuvering in traffic a breeze  i chose the premium package technology package sports package cold weather package and rear climate package with running boards and roof rack  i have put just over  miles on the vehicle and the onboard computer is reporting that my average speed is  miles per hour with a mpg of   this is better average mpg than my honda accord  i would recommend the x d to anyone
BMW,Engine/Performance,sudden untimely death we purchased our  bmw x suv in  with  miles and maintained it meticulously to approximately  miles when the engine had a total catastrophic failure in long boat key florida  the vehicle was towed initially to a bmw repair shop tuffys  kudos to them and then bmw of sarasota where it sits today  total catastrophic failure suddenly wheels locked engine died could not be restarted was completely unexpected for a well maintained luxury vehicle with only  miles
BMW,Engine/Performance,nice looking butwouldnt buy another one we bought this used cpo nice to have factory paid service  yr k miles but bmw wont give you a free maintenance oil change till k miles this oil change interval is not good for a hard working  cylinder turbo engine i ended up paying for the oil changes every  miles as i felt necessary for a k vehicle brake service under bmw dime doesnt replace rotors just pads yet try to have a brake service performed by bmw just changing pads is not allowed they wont  ok lets go to reliability absolutely horrific i have owned over  cars in my lifetime this being the worst  the car was in the shop last year over  months from transmission issues to other things the front suspension is designed to fail at k miles so plan on putting money in to it thankfully we purchased an extended warranty for  months and additional  yrs the nav must be updated yearly run flat tires dont last more than k miles at a cost of  every  months the ride is stiff even when switching from run flats to conventional tires i get so many compliments on this sav but omg what a maintenance nightmare bmw hourly repair rate is  per hour wont buy another one
BMW,,greate
BMW,Price/Value,oil field bought this car with  just  weeks ago  first issue minor oil ring seal leaked for a bit now the issue is its burning oil  do all bmw cars and trucks have oil issues went through this with the ci  ridiculous
BMW,Engine/Performance,bye bye x bought my x custom built in  delivered aug i put just about every option into it except that suspension optioni dont plan to offroad in my bmw so i didnt see the pointsales experience was horribleperformance is subparit suffers from horrible performance below  mphhesitation off the line and if you give it gas to accelerate it waits for about a second before kicking you in the shortsi assume this is because it is in th gear at mphafter a  years of driving it i have had enoughit has nice polish but the enginetranny is junkjust traded it for a volvo which isnt as polished but actually goes when i give it gas
BMW,Price/Value,bmw are terrible especially if buying from peoria very expensive to maintain especially if you buy it from peoria il cheaters theyll stab you as they did it on me bmw looks good but its not worth it trust me that was my second x i will never buy it again it was  and now we are in feb  and i sold it finally hate bmw and hate bmw peoria  illinois
BMW,Engine/Performance,buyer beware bought a x  and it has been a disaster car has gone down literally wouldnt start or drive  times in under the first  miles first time it was the batteryalternator second time it was an engine coil and now they claim my spark plugs went bad this is not to mention a defective dvd player that had to be replaced also one thing your salesperson wont tell you but every service guy knows right away is that verizon blackberrys do not work with the idrive system the idrive will go down about every two months you then have to unpair your phone take the battery out and reset up the phone they should tell people this before they buy the cars but they dont
BMW,Engine/Performance,new improved bmw x vehicle has plenty of power and handles very well my only two complaints are steering is a little stiff in parking lots and i having a resonating noise out of the exhaust between gears  my two previous bmws did not have those issues
BMW,Engine/Performance,this car is not very good to my liking the car was stiff i had to fill it up  times a week just doing my job showing homes on the mainline i thought it was overpriced for what you got and i myself spent over k on mine and i still do not see my investment coming back i had gotten the gps system in my vehicle and i thought it was very difficult to use and my widget would get stuck very often and that was annoying then it was the trunk it was super heavy to open and sometimes it would get stuck and there is  parts to it to get it open fully the back seats were very uncomfortable to ride in because they were hard as a rock and very stiff the x is one of the most awful terrain vehicles i have ever driven
BMW,Engine/Performance,whinny noise  as with a prior review my  x  also makes a whinny noise akin to a golf cart when engine is hot and when upshifting from st to rd gears  getting worse as mileage adds up  x to the dealership and nothing can be done as it is the alternator  give me my   back please   heard the   series is also having this problem   not acceptable for k cars
BMW,Engine/Performance,x i very disappointing i now have about  miles on my  x i  i had high expectations for a vehicle that i paid almost k for  however there is a persistent and annoying engine whine at slower speeds in the lower gears  it increases and decreases with engine speed and can be reproduced at about  rpm while stationary and in neutral  i think that it could be the clutch in the alternator  however two dealerships have told me that its normal for the  twin turbo get used to it or turn up the radio  i liked the car but this is unacceptable i need to get rid of this car i cant believe that any car manufacturer would approve this situation
BMW,Engine/Performance,worst car ever just tonight first time in year no engine light  my  year and i were celebrating look no engine light  of course we had to speak up over a squealing fan that conveniently stops squealing at the dealership  oh one year of ownership  dollars of maintenance never again bmw  i could go down the list but why bother just dont do it
BMW,Comfort/Interior,beautiful vehicle but still has flaws the x is beautiful but not flawless the navigation sucks and doesnt even give correct directions there was no dvd included to update it ive read elsewhere the dealer charges alot for a new one the ride is firm the seat bottoms on the active ventilated seats are hard flat and unsupportive they quickly become uncomfortable i had to buy a seat cushion to make them bearablethe drivers seat puts out alot of heat from underneath and behindthe transmission on the diesel isnt always smooth starting out now that i have close to  miles on the vehicle it sounds like the diesel is getting louder the worst thing of all was the way we were treated at the first bmw dealership
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,fun to drive few odd quirks delicate i purchased a  xd at long beach bmw  so far im not impressed with long beach bmw and may never return but that is another story for another time  one month in i still like the vehicle  it has a few odd quirks and some parts are of questionable durability but over all not bad and fun to drive  odd quirks rear tailgate button on keyless remote is too sensitive shoulder belt height is not adjustable  questionable durability plastic on under side of running boards and around wheel wells is not going to hold up already a few minor pits and scratches in the first  miles on average city streets  also one rim already scratched and i dont parallel park
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,rolling with the xfive how to use the navs bluetooth etc
BMW,Design/Style,very overrated rough not luxurious safety after owning  cars over  brands i wanted to try bmw  unfortunately it is a big disappointment  x  plus is acceleration it has the best acceleration among the cars i owned  the rest is disappointment  the ride is harsh reviews praise it for good feel of the road but it feels like nearly no suspension after a while it feels punishing it is very noisy it sounds like s cars or old delivery vehicles the layout of the features is ridiculous yes you can learn which feature is where but any time you forget you have to think hard where it was it is very difficult to drive precisely you release the breaks and the car jumps moving forward by  is close to impossible reliability is not good we right away went back to the dealer with malfunctioning hatch the light staying on the lift mechanism broke the battery drains at a crazy pace the running boards make it extremely difficult for me to get into the car i am above  and very uncomfortable for my wife   the position of park on the shift knob makes driving this car a big safety hazard in all other cars you put the knob forward to park but this car has rear drive  when tired the welllearned behavior kicks in  you push the know to the end and the cur starts going backward  i twice nearly hit two people my wife has done it twice  i would bet that many serious accidentsinjuries have happened and maybe even people got killed  i am going back to lexus or mercedes suv  sorry but after  years of owning it i only convinced myself how bad this car is
BMW,Engine/Performance,disappointing vehicle i purchased the car as a cpo and it has spent over  days at the dealership in the first  months while the car performance is amazing build quality and comfort are really bad the car is incredibly noisy on the road and all the plastics creak also the entertainment system is really disappointing for such an expensive vehicle first and last bmw way over rated and overpriced
BMW,Engine/Performance,think twice before buying a  x this is my rd bmw and it is the worst vehicle i have ever ownedi am an active mail and find it physically exhausting to drive because of the tight steering wheelif your normal driving pattern includes a lot of stop and gos you will find the transmission hesitatesthe road noise is louder than my toyota pickup truck not to mention the ride is stiffer than my pickup truckhere is my advice if you are seriously interested in this vehicle dont make the same mistake i did by taking it for an around the block test driveask thedealer to loan the x to you for the weekend and drive it where you livei own  vehicles  this is the last one out of the garage
BMW,Engine/Performance,ultimate
BMW,Design/Style,bmw i gran coupe
BMW,,bmw i
BMW,Price/Value,value finding this car with a minimum of dealer added extras is difficult and may entail european delivery nonetheless i was in a market that allowed me to shop amongst dealers i drove a number of coupes and sports cars and failed to find a car that met this ones road handling acceleration and overall value the engines quiet purr and the solid feel one gets from the steering wheel needs to be experienced and balanced against the competition at this price
BMW,Engine/Performance,terrible service plagued with problems where do i start oh i know bmw does not care about their customers i have owned to others in the past m and a  x my past experience lead me to purchase lease my  series love the performance its a fun little car but my  has just under k on on it and its been in for everything under the sun the fuel pump the window reg motor radio still doesnt work right you name it and the recalls i could not drive my car at night for a month while i waited for recall replacement taillight and let me add they provided a car for only a week terrible service i have never even at gm dealer had service that was so rude unprofessional and unaccommodating
BMW,Engine/Performance,fun but problemmatic ive owned a i for  months now its fun to drive but suffers from multiple problemsissues throttle response is poor for a car advertised as having no turbo lag my wife drives a saab  which has a better throttle response especially at low rpm dealer tells me performance is within spec i cant see the radio with polarized glasses on radio seems to shut down intermittently usually right after powerup dealer diagnosed a faulty fuel pump and im on a waiting list for a replacement apparently theyre on backorder runflat tires are a disappointment overall the car handles and accelerates well but is a disappointment compared to the e m i drove before the
BMW,Engine/Performance,screamin my wife always wanted a bmw convertible  we assumed the lease on this one from the original owner  we absolutely love the performance of this car but have been a little disappointed with the quality  the taillight assemblies have been replaced  times the third brake light lens just shattered while driving down the road  those were replaced under warranty but it is disappointing considering
BMW,Price/Value,what a car i took this car over on swapalease with  months left and lots of miles  i get to drive a  car which is way out of my league less than  with maintenance included  my biggest complaint were the front runflats which succumbed to a double blow out on a new jersey pothole  replaced with sumitomos at half the cost  car rides smoother and handles just as well  car is so heavily optioned i have not explored them all  there is no dip stick  when oil light comes on you press some buttons and its sensor told me it needed one quart  bmw told me to come in and they would add it gratis  service is very addicting
BMW,Design/Style,the dope coupe if you are looking for a sports carthis is it
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,my  bmw i coupe this is my th bmw since  and by far my least favorite this is due to the fact that it took a year to get my car running properly there are major issues with the fuel pump and turbos that require either software upgrades or complete replacement there are  class action lawsuits dealing with this issue which has caused the value of my car to drop over  grand in just  year i also had multiple paint issues that have finally been made right and my car now looks like it should have at delivery a year ago i blame the dealership for this and for not standing behind the car in the beginning its too bad that not all bmw dealerships are created equal also the fuel mileage is poor
BMW,Comfort/Interior,buyers beware i bought a  i used  huge mistake  while the car is easy on the eyes it is rough on the bank account within  month of buying this car i had to shell out  to have the pulleys replaced due to squealing   i drove the car less than  months when the headlights went out  its a cook  to replace these babies  next about  months later the thermostat goes out while i am in traffic in atlanta  this repair hit me for another   the car has a problem with rough idle where it will almost stall at red lights while sitting still with or without the ac on  i have taken the car to the shop twice only to be told that it is bad gas  what a lame response for i have no clue  most recent repair was an oil leak that costs me  and the tech says i need to replace the oil pan  another   currently i am tolerating the rough idle because they have no clue and the pulleys that were not replaced are squealing really bad  i hate this car  its my third and final bmw  i will never buy another bmw and highly recommend that you do not either
BMW,Service/Maintenance,bmw says do not put groceries in your trunk whatever you do do not put groceries in the trunk i have found out the hard way bmw has had issues with people putting items that may leak in the trunk and shorting out the car my car is in the shop with such issues or so they say bmw customer service told me today that you should not put groceries or anything of such in your trunk why was i not told this when i bought the car
BMW,Service/Maintenance,think hard before you buy i bought a  series a few months ago very unhappy with jackie cooper bmw in edmond ok poor service after the sale it is like they forget you exist also financed through bmw financial and they have a horrible website being unhappy with the car i considered trading and it lost  in a few months it is still like new and a  model and still lost  crazy i will never buy another bmw
BMW,Price/Value,material quality and standard features are awful sorry i cant agree with the other i reviewers i bought this  i used having previously owned a  ci for  years granted the ci had premium package and the i is base but the sensatech seats and door material on the i look cheap and the black shiny plastic in place of the wood grain or titanium trim is just plain tacky the ci felt like a luxury vehicle the i feels like an entrylevel hyundai or something i actually just sold a hyundai genesis t premium which had keyless entry keyless start universal remote moonroof nice trim automatic dimming mirrors and good bolstered seats it cost about k new the base i has none of those things and cost over k new yes the driveability is much better than a genesis but noticeably worse than a ci the gas mileage is worse than both of these other vehicles  overall im not overly impressed with the  series it feels like a step down even with more power than the ci and the genesis and a step backwards in time the bmw enthusiast in me wants to get rid of it as soon as possible and get a  series
BMW,Price/Value,had i gt  days in shop  days had the car for four days and the ddc failed dealer cannot fix the problem but they are trying i have no complaints with the dealer it is bmw that is the problem need a part from germany but it will take and i quote bmw weeks  to be continued
BMW,,li
BMW,Comfort/Interior,you cant go wrong i was a little bit skeptical whether i should go for the  series after several reviews i decided to go for it and see if there would be any headaches with owning a car like this the idrive is easy to use just make sure you dont use it while driving i almost rear ended several cars the comfort is out of this world you really feel like you are in a leer jet
BMW,Comfort/Interior,big mechanical waste bought this car for my wife and what a waste of space transmission head gaskets sensors galore bought is used and it spent  out of the first  months in the shop i will never buy another bmw again worst of all this site does not reflect what i here from every other mechanic and  bmw  owner shame on edmunds and to anyone looking at this car please please please look else where

BMW,Engine/Performance,not the ultimate driving machine since  this is my third seven series  this one is a cheap one corner shortcut features and i hate to say that i hate it  lets start with the stupidest item first that is the trunk key that in all cars it closes the trunk in this car it is designed to lock the doors therefore useless the doors of all high end cars open when the driver opens the drivers side door but in this car you also have to push to unlock button to open the other doors  seats are cheap and no support dash is simple flat like old american cars cockpit isnt designed like a bmw signature and cants see the small digits of temp hour and other information the radio is the worst i have ever seen the service says its because its a satellite radio and it sucks in all  seven series dont know if that is true or they just dont want to do anything about it the performance isnt like prior models and the body looks like a whale simple and a long box i was debating between this and a maserati  and  chose this because of promotional monthly lease and  included service  you get what you pay for

BMW,Price/Value,had the car a total of  days in  weeks i really dont know what to say about this car other than im very disappointed  had it for  hours and it died twice  got it back a week later and it died again  both times it died while driving needless to say i had it towed out of my garage and did not want it back  i was given a   loaner and that died toocoincidence or is someone trying to tell me something  dont get me wrong the car is beautiful but should be spitting out rainbows for the price of the car  it was fully loaded everything you can get i had in the car  so as the saying goes  times is a charm i am waiting for the new  which replaces the first one i leased  wish me luckif this one dies i will never go back  such a shame
BMW,Engine/Performance,unsatisfied customer excellent engine plenty of powers idrive  terrible mistake had so many problems with it  mechanical support from the dealer is terrible  they do not know how to fix it  i left the car for  days last month to fix the air conditioner fan took in three times for the same problem about the seat belt warning sign within the first  months afrer the purchase of the car my patients think think that i am working at  bmw dealer because i drove so many different bmws loaners from the dealer to work the  series was a mistake and i will never buy bmw near future even though i have two as of now i am a bit afraid to drive this car
BMW,Engine/Performance,owner review imagine on a  month lease shop time in excess of  days one and half months out of  three days to re program the computer replacement parts always available but not the same day  two repairs to the trunk lid an engine hood that doesnt stay open  this was my second  series car and a total disappointment relative to reliability  after the dealership initiated a daily rate for a loaner car i chose to take my business elsewhere  imagine paying for a loaner for the second repair to a warrantee covered item  on a car in this price range
BMW,Engine/Performance,never again each required visit to the dealer for repair results in having to return to have at least  additional items corrected idiot drive aside safety issues are of primary concern  months for bmw to figure out they had to replace the modual that controls the remote key plastic emergency key required to open a  car intermitant operation of headlights and tail lights engine goes into idle mode at the slightest touch of break pedal i thought the  s was trouble prone but would gladly trade back the li is my wifes car which i have limited her use to daylight driving only for security reasons she drives our expedition or town car when venturing out after dark

BMW,Service/Maintenance,my worst nightmare this car is the worst mistake i have
BMW,Comfort/Interior,noisy luxury vehicle i owned a  bmw i which i considered the ultimate driving machine prior to purchasing the  bmw  li x shortly after purchasing the vehicle i noticed the wind noise and road noise was almost unbearable i complained to the service advisors and was told that either they couldnt hear any unusual noise then it was the road then it was the runflat tires the adaptive headlights provides poor night vision on dark roads drivers seat material worn excessive at   miles there is vibration during takeoff there is little to no storage space for cell phones etc in the console or glove boxes  when steering wheel is adjusted for me mileage temperature and navigation controls are obstructed vehicle feels heavy bulky and requires a firm grip handling cargo space is rather small for such a large sedan
BMW,Engine/Performance,second bmw  series in our family got my i a year ago car was from  years lease program bmw canada provides extended warranty on it on delivery there were quite a few problems   thermostat knocking in steering column alignment weak front drive shaft bmw fixed everything without questions after one year of owning have no problems at all
BMW,Engine/Performance,"bmw  is the worst car i have ever owned i have owned various high end vehicles and have always found them to be well constructed and a pleasure to drive that is until my bmw il  during the warranty period i had to make numerous visits to service for warning lights etc and the dealer mechanics could never identify a problem  that is until the car was just outside the k miles warranty  then the problems started en masse at k major engine repairs valve seals and  three of the four electric window controls failed about k miles later had to repair ball joints leaking oils components battery etc my view stay away from bmw at any cost they claim superior enginerring but exact opposite in my case"

BMW,Comfort/Interior,disappointment the car soso but stay away from
BMW,Comfort/Interior,good car but much to complexity both as user and read other reviews which describe the car as a good handling very comfortable car that is overly complex for the driver  and ridiculous in terms of servicing  all true   i have owned and worked on cars for  years and the unnecessary and pointless complexity of the controls particularly of the single knob to control many interior functions is several orders of magnitude worse than any other car including benz rolls and luxury american cars mostly gm   this  li  is some techies wet dream but a total nightmare for someone who wants just to use the car and have some reliability and not program it just trying to get some usually simple function to work like the radio or ac   also ridiculously expensive service new key fob and programing at dealers  per replacement key  for a  to  of value   bmw rips off its customers over and over  never buy one again wifes idea  very very bad value but meets her needs for prestige car all she cares about and i am stuck with the outsized bills and frequent failures of water pumps hoses ac etc etc etc ad nauseum  must be worse of all cars and designed to be needing very frequently very very expensive repairs  i thought benz and rolls were ridiculously expensive and overrated but this bmw is in a class by itself almost as expensive as my cessna  about as overpriced as possible but delivers something special fast turbo prop aircraft able to get into and out of short fields with max load and not nearly as user friendly or as well made as the cessna but with about the same complexity and frequently required very expensive service like the cessna without any of the cessna benefits   summary overpriced piece of   ripoff in every way but a nice car in the infrequent times it actually runs and most everything works between nearly constantly recurring service to replace something which is overpriced and poorly designed and poorly made causing frequent failures    makes the cessna look like a reasonably priced and low maintenance machine which it certainly is not
BMW,Service/Maintenance,worst car i ever had i would never buy this piece of junk it is just a waste of money too many issues i purchased a  year old cpo i a few months later i found out that it has original air filters installed the dealer did not even bother to check the basics i filed a complain both written and by phone i wasted so many hours but no results the customer rep says that the dealer is not answering them what a bs

BMW,Engine/Performance,major repairs   miles i bought this wellcaredfor car from a private owner in  car had  miles   after  years and  additional miles both my alternator and water pump failed total bill including hoses and thermostat was  labor parts and  state sales tax other minor problems over the past three years include peeled finish on the bmw hood emblem due to drive thru car wash brushes about  to replace   a bargain and i had broken clips on front plastic kidney grilles breakage may have been due to engine heat each grille costs about  to replace oh yeah just like so many other reviewers my cup holder is broken too maybe its time to sell
BMW,Price/Value, il cosmos black on black this is a classic luxury sports car  i had always wanted one  but make no mistake this is an extremely expensive car to fixrepair  a k auto of this level of sophistication is very touchy  so be prepared
BMW,Price/Value,fun car to drive  but it is no lexus the bmw  is with out a doubt the best driving large sedan on the market however it suffers from serious flaws that one would not expect from a car that costs in excess ot  the on board computer dispay failed the dealer said pixel burnout was common at about  years i have a broken the cupholder and numerous climate control knobs fail one door panel has had problems staying on as does the side panel it seems to cost me  thousand dollars every time i see my dealer i have probably had  worth of suspension work done over the last  months my previous car was a mercedes s at about the same age had very few problems quite frankly the bmw has been a terrible car
BMW,Comfort/Interior,bmw il i have just recently purchased a il
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,do not buy this car problems problems problems u name it  oil leaks  smokes windows fall dwn pcv valve most horrible car
BMW,Engine/Performance,transmission issues do not buy engine and transmission issues do not buynice car and very expensive to have this type of expensive issues
BMW,Service/Maintenance,safety concerns the softclose doors on our car have failed multiple times creating a signficant safety hazard that continues to be ignored by our dealer and bmw coporatethe driver door has failed multiple timesimagine the terror of having to drive down a highway worrying that your door will not latch and stay closedimagine having kids in the car and your back door pops open while taking a curveyes this severe unimaginable problem has been ignored as normal wear and tear rather than the disaster waiting to happen that it is for bmwdid they not watch the prius debacle on tv did they not learn
BMW,Price/Value,dont do it i bought a demo thinking this is the ultimate driving machine boy was i wrong everything is too expensive the car has been in the shop  times since i bought it the sound system is just plain bad the dvd player doesnt work and it took forever to figure out how to change the clock or even the radio station that is unless you want to read the  page manual which tells you how to do so is it a head turner   yes without a doubt but in todays economy when you take in to account the price of gas insurance the overall cost of owning it i say dont do it
BMW,Service/Maintenance,programming i find this car very hard to program  i received very little help from the dealership  the owners manual stated the dealership would help with programming the vehicle to your specifications  this has not happened  this takes away all the fun of driving the car  i wish someone could put me in touch with a service center that can help me
BMW,Price/Value,stay away do not buy this car unless its under warranty valve problem burning and leaking oil  its a  dollar job dont waist ur money and this is my second car but never again
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmw and safe driving bmw has a good look and performance but everything else are poor i drive this car a year and i am not impressed the major problem is with service and wheels and runflat tires the aluminum wheels keep cracking in normal driving conditions and suddenly your tires can lost all air in higher speed driving my car has k miles and had to replace all tires and two rear wheels it is costly but bmw denies to take the blame this is a bad design and bmw blaming owners of bad driving while it is due to very stiff tires which transmit vibrations to the rims which cracks on top they dont have tires to replace and you need to wait a week while driving a junk cari dont recommend bmw at all
BMW,Engine/Performance,im very disappointed i traded in a  il for a  i  though i like the looks drive and performance of the  the gas mileage is so bad that is should be illegal  when i drive around in regular city driving where the traffic is reasonable i get  miles per gallon  i think this is a travesty  and the  miles per gallon that bmw states on the car sticker is just a lie  im very upset and if bmw cant correct  this problem im going to turn the car in  ive had a  series every year for the past  years this  model is a major disappointment regarding the gas mileage problem
BMW,Service/Maintenance,bmw  quality horrible  miles and rear end was rattling over any road imperfections dealer tore apart rear end then had been dealing with suspension bushings  r u kidding me bmw   series sunroof was even loud allowing in air passage
BMW,Price/Value,bmw  li xdrive about  months ago the car started sputtering when you accelerate  i found online that you can take your bmw li xdrive  in for a customer care package  they did not call it a recall but a customer care package i thought this would correct the problems because they replace some sensors and vacuum  hose but the problem is still there bmw did a full diagnostic and said remove and replace all injectors x ignition coils xand spark plugs x during the inspection found the vehicle misfiring final cost will run  my warranty company will refuse to pay because they wanted to know what would you replace all  injectors and all of the other parts because all  injectors cant be bad  the warranty company think bmw know they have a faulted injection systems and trying to upgrade and correct the problem at the customer expense  the car burn major oil bmw claim this is normal i will get a second opinion  this is the worst car i have ever own and when you spend a  on a car you expect to drive it more then  years without all of the problems these car has cost us  i thought bmw quality meant something to the company  their name and their customerswbakccbcf  c

BMW,Engine/Performance,not user friendly the door handles have to be pulled twice to get in or out of the car the door unlock is in the center of the dash its inconvenient the automatic transmission is difficult to get into park difficult for anew driver to get into drive its very easy to turn on the paddle shifters when putting into drive my wife refuses to drive it anymore the garage door opener was impossible to set i gave up i have set it for years on american cars the electronics or command in center console not user friendly i would never buy another bmw or german car american cars are much more user friendly
BMW,,m
BMW,Engine/Performance,so many annoying things bmw when will you learn i am driving the  model the more i drive it the less i like it as many professional reviewers have noted the engine sounds really unpleasant the shifter can be infuriating esp changing between forward and reverse is very slow and requires the driver to engage the brake pedal for a significant amount of time the navigation system is laughable in the age of google maps sometimes i still use it but dont put your car in reverse after you entered your destination the backup camera will come on and wipe out your destination entry as for the backup camera horrible contrast and low light performance where does bmw even buy such low quality components one of the most annoying things is that you cannot lock the car when you park it in neutral hard to believe but true you have to turn the engine back on and put it in drive then get back out and lock it if you leave it in neutral it will sit unlocked completely drain its battery and go dead in a matter of hours
BMW,Service/Maintenance,black f m negotiate terms and get the tire care plus
BMW,Design/Style,my white  m coupe i traded up from a yellow m  everyone had to look at that car whether it was in awe or disgust  however until i got my m never has a member of the opposite sex flirted with me from their car  it has happened  times since july th  this car turns heads who see it  moreover it turns heads of people who hear it going by  the acceleration over  mph is insane and it feels like  mph is only   would prefer if it had more distinctive flare like my m  it does not even have a raised hood  when you sit down in it and turn it on and it rumbles into place there is not much better a feeling to a driving person on earth  if you are looking at porsche turbo drive this car too
BMW,Service/Maintenance,tranny issues that cannot be resolved do not buy this car unless you have a written warranty on all aspects of the smg transmission the dealer will sell you this car as an automatic with a rd party warranty but when it fails and it will the rd party says that it is a manual transmission with normal wear and tear  later you will still have a car that doesnt work anyone need any m parts
BMW,Design/Style,my bmw  convertible
BMW,Engine/Performance,second  series in  month

BMW,Price/Value,until you drive it you wont get it i said i would not get a car without ventilated seats and with black leather in nc until i drove this thing i also said i wouldnt fork out the money for the adaptive m suspension holy cp this is like flying in an f bmw lost their mojo after  but they are back
BMW,Price/Value, bmw i convertible expensive but reliable
BMW,Comfort/Interior,bmw x with the m package  never again i purchased this car for my wife in   it is a  model  it had k miles on it when we purchased it  we now have k  this one had about every option except navigation which i didnt want anyhow and  wheels  ours had the  wheels  first the m package is the sharpest looking of all of these xs  it body colors every component of the car and you dont get the black plastic around the wheel wells  it has been a fairly reliable car but like any highly optioned vehicle it has stuff to break  i will try to list everything that has been wrong or ive had to fix  first thing to go wrong was the subwoofer under the passenger side seat went bad  then the right hand door speaker followed  the right mirror doesnt fold any more nor does it selfdim or heat  i assume its a power problem  the valve cover started leaking and the ccv diaphragm built into the valve cover went bad  that requires a new valve cover to fix  also lost a water pump  they are electric so a new one installed was   next was a starter and alternator another grand to replace those  the transfer case has a motor that has a gear on it it went bad  i saved a bundle by replacing the gear myself  bmw doesnt carry just a gear for it but some ingenuous person makes them and i bought one  bmw wants  for a new motor  the right hand door seal has leaked under hard rains forever  it gets the carpet wet at times  its a poor design  i had to replace the rear door vapor barrier as it too was getting the rear carpet wet  the bolster heater on the drivers side seat burned through the leather and burned a hole my wifes nice north face jacket  i hear its a common problem on bmws that could have been disastrous  the ambient temperature sensor hasnt read correctly since day one  it is always off about  degrees  one day the left dash side window defroster vent just popped off  the little prong that holds it in just broke off  the washer jug fluid motors both went bad  they would leak all of the washer fluid out  the pop up washers for the headlights quit working  no loss there i hated the things anyhow  my wife loves the car and wants another one  when she starts fixing it she can have another  im thinking lexus rx next time
BMW,Engine/Performance,do not buy a bmw x we have taken the x to the shop about  times for engine overheating problems  computer problems do not buy bmw x will bring you problems contacted bmw headquarters and they do not help they dont care about the customer and if you run out of warranty you will have to pay  for an extended warranty or trade in the suv not reliable my kids dont want to take trips left us stranded on i bmw does not care
BMW,Design/Style,a bit disappointed i guess i expected more from my first bmw   my wife hated the way it drove around town so now its mine  the transmission is definitely a design flaw and there should be a recall  on the highway it rides like a dream  its like riding on a rail and it takes discipline to stay below  mph  i had a lifter noise and after several visits to service they had to replace the cylinder head  that was another nightmare  the dealer and bmw should have made a better effort to compensate for my inconvenience
BMW,Engine/Performance,disappointed this is my second x the st a  so i expected a better bmw but what i got was what others are complaining about poor shifting patterns at speeds under  mph has been in the shop for software fixes but no improvements and the techs tell me they dont notice the problem the sport drive is horrible and this is called a sport utility vehicle this is not what i expected from bmw
BMW,Engine/Performance,goodbye  i finally had enough took a major loss by trading in the  x bought the car for k and got k in trade in  the transmission problem in my opinion is dangerous and makes the car unpredictable in many situations turns acceleration from stop although i brought it back to the dealer for the fix the problem persisted in my opinion it is a disgrace that bmw has the audacity to label this thing the ultimate driving machine i have been permanently soured by the bmw brand goodbye
BMW,Engine/Performance,makes me nauseated transmission shifting issues  shifts so jerky it will actually make me car sick  have had back to dealer x for updates shifting improved but not even close to acceptable for any vehicle but this one is k  dealer told me fix is to shift manually  no thanks i didnt buy a stick shift  live in western pa lots of hills car will not shift out of nd gear starting up a hill unless speed exceeds  mph  thats about  rpm when you take your foot off the gas it throws you like hitting the brakes  terrible engineering from a premier automotive company
BMW,Price/Value,bad transmission i bought this vehicle to be both fun and utility vehicle the transmission behaves so erratically it is downright dangerous on more than several occasions its lack of response has cause near fatal accidents it typically hesitates between  gear which is where you are at when entering a turnabout or merging into traffic quickly the sports drive mode down shifts so hard that you swear you have been rearended by another driver bmwna has tried to pass this off as part of the adaptive or learning features of this car
BMW,Engine/Performance,x weaknesses there is definite hesitation when attempting quick acceleration  the gps is horrendous  neither my husband nor myself have figured out how to enter addresses  it just shouldnt be this difficult  his aftermarket gps works like a dream  not only is it easy to imput data but also warns of traffic slow downs and alternative routes  the stereo is mediocre  the controls are mediocre
BMW,Engine/Performance,transmission problems reporting back after  miles driven this x has a faulty transmission it causes hesistation on acceleration from a stop in curves on hills and in turns the transmission needs to be reprogrammed reference sb  even after reprogramming the transmission is erratic would be very careful before purchasing
BMW,Engine/Performance,worst new car i ever owned i bought my new x a week ago and it is a total nightmare  i did not know that there was a major engine hesitation with many of these vehicles and mine is very bad and even dangerous  the steering is not aligned due to either a wheel alignment issue or the wheel itself is not centered  the controls including the navigation system are way too complex and awkward and using knobs to control everything is absurd my car has cosmetic defects on the fabric on doors and pillars and it looks like they totally left out the quality in this suv  overall should have got the rdx
BMW,Service/Maintenance,not a good ownership experience i have had my x for  years and will never purchase another bmw it started out with having a faulty rim i then have had  window regulators replaced starting within the first year of ownership i have also replaced the transfer case and rear differential costing over  now the transfer case motor has failed i have only put  miles on my car in the  years i have owned it you failed bmw i will not be a repeat customer
BMW,Price/Value,everything is going wrong at k plus i have had the x for nearly two years i am now having all sorts of issue about to have to replace the compressor at k already had to replace front brakes need rear brakes now have problems with the locking system also rear lighter cover wont stay closed overall i have enjoyed driving the suv still with a sports car feel wish i would have bought the extended warranty
BMW,Price/Value,not good quality for this model needs a lot of maintenance on brakes tires are expensive the moon roof does not work it will cost like  to fix the first gear jumps really bad i scare to drive it now and the ac compressor went out not a smart buy i have  miles on it
BMW,Service/Maintenance,bmw lemon based on my how many times ive had to take my x that i bought new from bmw i would say that there are now some bmw lemons on the market all the parts that they have had to replace in my   years of owning the vehicle are as follows and please note that i have no kids                                                                              fuse in charging station                back up camera      part of sunroof mechanism because the sunroof was open and stuck     now the warning has come on the dash board showing that there is something wrong with the seatbelt          work on transmission as there was an issue with accelerating although the dealership never acknowledged this but the vehicle accelerated much better after picked it back up from the dealership                                                                                                                                                              i dont think that ill buy another bmw vehicle due to my horrible experience with this luxury vehicle i expected this of an american low end vehicle
BMW,Design/Style,never again ive owned infinity for years and thought it was time for a change and so got the bmw x iits terrible  the intelligence that went into this design is incomprehensible  the instrumental panel is nearly totally dark i have to leave headlights on in the day time and even then its hard to seethere is no separation for the navigation display to reduce lights when night driving if you reduce display for navigation so you can see the instrument dulls as well meaning you cannot see how fast you are going  there is virtually zero ability to see clock temps or any other instrumentsthere is no display for tire pressure  there are so many stupid things that the germans missed with this that as soon as my plates come in i am getting rid of it and going back to infinity even hubby who is german says even germans dont buy bmw because there are no options on the cars unless you pay outrageous prices for them  japan has it all over the imports from europe in this regardi rented a kia that has more options and better visibility than this bmwvery unhappy the gas tank holds about  gallons and so you have to fill up every three days its just a ridiculous car
BMW,Price/Value,bmw x compare
BMW,Comfort/Interior,bmw needs to learn to design seats i leased a  bmw x  x drive with the m sports package for my wife we were hoping to use the vehicle for a road car i have tried to sit in the front seats of the car they are abysmal i do not feel my size is unusual at  and  lbs i am unable to sit in them for  more than  minutes without being very uncomfortable in my   years of sitting in automobile seats have never sat in the front seat of any model of any car or truck and been uncomfortable if you are a person of small stature the seats in this vehicle are tolerable make sure any guest you will have in your x will be the same size i sent an email to the bmw geniuses  but have not gotten a response my review of the bmw discussion groups shows this bad seat design in the x has been an issue for quite a while if you are test driving this car you need to drive it for  to  minutes at a minimum if you cant sit comfortably in the car to drive it everything else about the car is meaningless i would recommend any other vehicle than the x
BMW,Price/Value,worse vehicle ever rides rough lots and lots of repairs i have had the moon roof repaired  times over k new brakes lots of electronic problems water pump radiator heck the whole car has had problems  i only have k miles on the car it has cost me a fortune
BMW,Engine/Performance,extremely poor reliability this car has terrible reliability in  yrs i have spent nearly  in repairs two ac compressor hoses sunroof leak air mass meter all for o sensors complete radiator replacementdo not buy this car
BMW,Design/Style,not happy this is my second bimmer i realize it is not the luxury model of my i but the sunroof rattles the fuses to my v outlets keep blowinginterior black on black is peeling none of these things are covered and i must pay for diagnostic to discover problems and then they arent covered by warranty  im thinking about trading love the look hate the quality
BMW,Design/Style,disappointed the car is not built very well  it has developed all sorts squeaks creaks and rattles the ride is very firm even a slightest road irregularity gives you a hard jolt the cargo capacity is surprisingly low although the car does not look too small i would not buy this car again and would not recommend it to anyone else
BMW,Service/Maintenance,nothing to get excited about this is a noisy uncomfortable vehicle with nothing to recommend it except for sitting up high  its power is ordinary its ride is noisy and rough  it has a strange rattle in the sunroof  after all is said and done it is overpriced too
BMW,Engine/Performance,first time beemer fan for life gfriend turned me on to bmw  i wanted the utility space high sitting position and a sport like performance  this car like the write ups states is the car to get  only draw backs the arm rests  slightly slanted downward my arm never finds comfort  the leg room seems a bit confining  however with all the adjustments it all works out  gas fuel economy is not too bad if you are patient at  mph  i have clocked  mpg on the hway  usual combined city hway     in a l engine with  hp  that rocks
BMW,Engine/Performance,x rides like a truck i now have  miles on my bmw x awd with the  engine  the reliability is excellent and i have had no maintenance problems  the ride of the car is the big issue i have this as a leased vehicle for  months and i can hardly wait for the th month  i have even tried to trade this car for a different bmw at the dealer but getting out of a lease is too expensive  the car rides like a truckespecially in the rear seat  i feel sorry for those who have to sit back there so i usually take a different car if anyone has to sit back there  the leather seats in the rear are uncomfortable too  the people in the rear are bumped up and down even on smooth roads
BMW,Engine/Performance,stiff ride very stiff ride without sport package i wonder if the tires make a difference mine has michelins
BMW,Engine/Performance,ill keep it  performance and quality top notch ride rough on rough roads
BMW,Design/Style,disappointed in bmw engineering i have had my  x for  years now and very disappointed in bmw engineering very poor engineering and i had to do repairs frequently cannot count but the recent one was starter and ipbs switch that costed me
BMW,Engine/Performance,never again i just got my  bmw x a few months ago back in april i bought it off a used lot and as i drove away the engine light came on ive taken it in multiple times and ive had everything from my radio just suddenly not wanting to work to my car cutting off in the middle of a busy intersection this car has almost gotten me in many accidents with its poor driving performance i actually had it in the shop for a week during thanksgiving and as soon as i got it back it broke down and left me stranded the day after i got it back to the repair place and it magically had  new issues we have spent well over k in the past few weeks on this vehicle i would absolutely never suggest this car to anyone especially as their first car unless you want to constantly have your car in the shop and  money in  your wallet i will never purchase a bmw ever again they say to get rid of a bmw once it hits  miles i should have listenedoh and not to mention its horrible gas mileage i fill up every week and it costs around  bucks every time its ridiculous
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmw never again i have owned  bmws over the last  years  were good cars  were not the current  x is the worst of the lot body water leaks engine oil leaks sensor failures water pump failure ignition coil failures transmission failure you name it and i have had to have it fixed all before the car reached  miles i purched the car from bmw as a certified used car and had trouble with it from the beginning the dealer was of little help they just kept telling me the transmission was fine until the extended warrenty ran out then it was  it failed and you need to replace it  at a cost of  grand bmw is not the ultimate driving machine they are the ultimate maintenance machine
BMW,Engine/Performance,never again first and last bmw   quality is not what you would expect from a high end vehicle  problems started almost immediately the warranty covered the repairs not the in convince of the wasted time  after warranty ran out k milesreplaced window regulator on passenger window at k miles replaced all  sparks plugs at  k replaced valve cover gasket at k replaced water pump  now at k all  engine mount bolts have shearedvibration broke the water pump  never again disappointed in bmws responses
BMW,Comfort/Interior,sheared motor mount bolts  bmw x with  miles sheared all  motor mount bolts in normal street drivingbmw said tough lucka quick internet search indicated this was not an isolated incident many other relatively low mileage bmws have had sheared motor mount boltsi believe this problem to be a serious safety issue and filed a complaint with the national highway traffic safety administrationi encourage others that have had similar problems to file nhtsa complaints at the following websitesafercargovclick the report a vehicle or child seat defect tab and submit your complaintif there are enough complaints bmw will hopefully be forced to acknowledge this problem
BMW,Engine/Performance,im very much disappointed ive just finished the  year warranty with my car as of september st  the car was at the dealer several times the gas odometerdoesnt show the actual gas in the tank even the tank is full until several days later it doeslet me pump gas into it and keep stop getting gas even the tank is not half yet the water pump was not working just  year for a brand new x the dealer had to replace a new pump because the engine shut off while i was driving several times due to no coolant water in the engine now the warranty is over just  days the car is just k and the coolant water pump having the problem againim very disappointed and regret that i bought this expensive car
BMW,Price/Value,brakes failed my x brakes failed causing a major accidentthe accident resulted in approximately  worth of damagebmw denied any brake issueswhen i picked the vehicle up from bmw body shop i had to return itall of the brake indicator lights on the dashboard lit up i loved how my vehicle handled but there were frequent trips to the repair shop including previous brake jobsit was disturbing and disappointing that bmw denied a major issue that could have resulted in casualtiesbmw blamed the car mats for the accident sounds familiaryet they returned the vehicle with mats in same positioncar was in service  wks before accidenta coworker friend had similiar experience
BMW,Engine/Performance, x problem prone ive owned bmws for the last  years i love the way they handle fortunately my  x is a lease  at k a chronic very loud engine tapping began akin to the vehicle in the movie chitty chitty bang bang i had it serviced at least  times by k the tapping reduced to a soft finger strumming it still taps but i deal with it  the engine strains on small  big hills  fails to shift the car has on multiple occasions locked me inside  neither the unlocking mechanism nor the windows opened i drove to the dealer called them on my cell had them force the window down  climbed out  the interior handles cup holders arm rests etc are peeling have been replaced once
BMW,Engine/Performance,part  of n engine really has problems my review somehow incorrectly stated the miles on my x the engine valve issue started at k not k as it states and the car only has knot k as the reviews states and yes it has been in the shop  times in a year and a half the followup to my last review after being in the shop for the th time bmw thinks the valve slamtapping is normal you should hear this especially during a cold startit sounds like crap no kidding it slams and thumps like crazy and this was after the cylinder head replacement the sound comes and goes still bmw will not do much for you after these attempts to fix a defective engine accept tell you that the sound is normal be warned future bmw buyers
BMW,Service/Maintenance,first and last bmw well german engineering aside this suv has been the worst new car i have ever owned in  years of driving  it lives at the dealer  so far still cannot fix the hesitation issue which is severe in normal d moon roof significant issues needed new exhaust at k miles blower motor issues navigation system is major piece of junk now satellite radio is defective and no parts to fix it x drive is lousy in the snow not really a true awd system etc  horrible vehicle trying to get out of the lease early  when get loaner car usually a  series love it  x is just a bmw fiasco stay far far away from any of these until they redesign it  oh love heating steering wheel
BMW,Comfort/Interior,solid for a challenging climate for me driving in major snow storms is a given  this vehicle does everything you need it to do and feels rock solid  i drove through a monster storm this morning and to a ski resort last week on poor road conditions i was never concernedit tracks the road is very stable and in the worst storm is balanced and steady   unlike some larger suvs i have had the size and weight distribution on this vehicle provides a feel for the road surface and an ability to get you there  this vehicle is for someone who wants a smaller suv that can get you around in the worst of conditions  and of course its a bmw so it goes without saying that the interior the reliability and the extras are fantastic
BMW,Comfort/Interior,after k miles its time to walk away i leased this  x in december of  unfortunately i regret the decision the x is no doubt an excellent driver for a lb small suv by small i mean the interior is very small and cramped and only after owning this vehicle for some time i now know it has limited utility and horrid resale value others such as the lincoln mkx are cheaper by thousands and more practical in every way
BMW,Engine/Performance,overpriced horrid bmw model this is an update of an original posting  the bmw x has horrible engine and transmission response  the dealer can not remedy it as no more software updates are out from bmw but i do not think any more computer programs will solve the potentially dangerous throttle response you do not go anywhere at times when merging  the navigation system is awful i had to buy a magellan unit  the handling is subpar think the crappy cheap pirelli str part to blame but not up to bmw standards  bmw corporate is impossible to deal with they are of no help at all
BMW,Design/Style,disappointed this is our second bmw  we are so disappointed with the quality of construction  the front bumper a pathetic piece of plastic just buckled and fell when going over a bump   told by a bmw service agent that this is happening so frequently with the x that people are not even bothering to fix the bumper they just drive around with it hanging  this is unconscionably  poor construction design and quality  there are other issues with the quality of materials used in the construction of this car  this is definitely our last bmw and if it wasnt a lease i would get rid of it immediately
BMW,Comfort/Interior,remember  its a bmw remember youre buying this car bc it handles incredibly acceleration is great i experience no hesitation this car is fun to drive  lots of fun to drive i get  mpg however the electronics are horrible i got the upgraded stereo and wish i hadnt sirius costs  to install only available through bmw and its the worst antenna  continuously drops the signal the read out is limited to the point of annoying the radio only has  presets the gps yeah i went for that too is incredibly useless  difficult to use the manual is awful why do they allot so much space to longitude latitude and altitude its ridiculous did i say it handles incredibly
BMW,Engine/Performance,just not worth the money this is my nd x in  months  i had so many problems with  that bmw bought out my lease and i ordered another one would not let me totally out of the lease  these are overpriced and not up to par with japanese vehicles  problems transmission does not mesh with engine hesitation brakes grab oem tires were awful in snow last few weeks took them off before slid into something  navigation system is archaic  radio even upgraded one just does not provide quality sound  this is definitely not the ultimate driving machine  i would never recommed an x to anyone else  i do not know how other reviews are favorable  guess just taken away with bmw emblems all over the car
BMW,Mileage/Fuel, x problematic i have had nothing but problems with my x the software for the bluetooth phone and gps had to be reloaded several times because it starts acting flaky and eventually just dies every  months the gps has the worst user interface i have ever seen the bluetooth phonebook interface is horrible if you have a pda the ipod adapter is useless does not display artist or title the main issue though is the transmission its jerky especially when going uphill or passing on a highway also the gas mileage is way below what they advertise
BMW,Service/Maintenance,bucket list the car is great little things are popping up that is annoying and have to take to dealership the dealership does not give you an answer unless you bring it in the shop
BMW,Design/Style,have a backup vehicle i have owned my bmw x i for  years now in that time i have spent almost  in repairs it it not a reliable car and i am surprised by this given the bmw reputation i am looking to get ride of this car asap i will never own another bmw again
BMW,Engine/Performance,worst bmw ever i bought this vehicle use with low mileage only  miles at  miles i spent over  and work some of the work was covered under warranty the alternator let go it has a front engine crankshaft seal leak check engine light went on like  times and check battery and low control system  at the dealership could not find anything wrong with it air flow sensor damage when to replace it with a  but they have a  cylinder turbo engine for a vehicle that weight of a  pound whats going to happen years down the road i would not recommend bmw to anybody
BMW,Service/Maintenance,insane i just dont even know where to begin with this hunk of nonpermissible content removedfirst ill start by agreeing with every negative comment ive read on this review boardjust purchased this junk on wheels less than one year ago and its already going back to bmw for service for the fifth timei had to bring the car in for its first service owning it for three dayslittle did i know this was just the beginningplease please listen to all the reviews on this boardconsider something else
BMW,Service/Maintenance,i like it but i am in month  and while i love the incomparable bmw handling every time i drive it i am frustrated by the unnecessarily complicated shifter and the door locking systemi would not buy this car again if it had the same awkward shifter or if the door locking could not be reprogrammedi am constantly pulling on locked door handles but have been told by my dealer that this cannot be changed for safety reasonsfunny that lexus does not have that concerni also dont like the navigation displaynot enough street names are clearly identified and the background colors make it hard to readby comparison my wifes lexus suv has a dazzlingly clear and complete navigation screen
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,my new xnext time maybe i will buy a hyundai i would like to know why i could go purchase a k hyundai w less problems than i have in my k xcup holder  has a broken spring mechanism heater button  when pushed it went into the bottom of the center counsel gas cap  it states diesel but the car uses gasoline alignment  the vehicle consistently pulls slightly to the rightowners manual states there is supposed to be a first aid kit pg  none squeak  sounds like styrofoam rubbing togetherjerky start  seems like the fuel pumpinjector issue bmw has been havingutterly disappointed with this vehicle
BMW,Engine/Performance,my new x i just bought the car a week ago i notice this car is having problem during low speed stop and go condition you can feel the transmission is shifting hard from st to nd gear under slight acceleration and this is really annoying during traffic jam
BMW,Comfort/Interior,all is not perfect vehicle weighs almost  pounds and feels very solid  finish is second to none  steering lacks a road feel and high crosswinds cause vehicle to wander i long for rack and pinon steering instead of electric assist  interior controls take time to learn what to do
BMW,Comfort/Interior,a mediocre car in drag as a luxury vehicle what happened to bmw the steering is dead numb the handling is ponderous and the interior is cheap and they want how much other than acceleration i cant think of one thing this does better than a mazda cx and the design is clunky im no bmw hater i have bought  new bmws over the past  years but this one does nothing for me ultimate driving to the mall machine
BMW,Price/Value,careful with this one technology controls are counter intuitive hard to get used to and learn   miles per gallon  a bit low expect high gas bills  not all options working as they should and cannot be tested car is supposed to be highly customizable but isnt for some desired features  why should dealer tell you tires are runflats that cost  only after the car was sold
BMW,Price/Value,people shouldnt buy bmw anymore the car still costs the same but the warranty drops from  years k to  years k shame on bmw i will switch to a different model after my lease i had already switched one of my vehicles shame on you again bmw
BMW,Price/Value,one of the best cars bmw has made in awhile not cheap but worth it  at least for the mi model this thing drives and handles like a sports car i occasionally park next to a mustang shelby gtkr with the racing strips etc we checked  times on the website  same times  granted the mustang is  years old but thats insane
BMW,Engine/Performance,engine clatter bought for my daughter to take to grad school  in shop in denver several times for engine clatter always told noise was normal and dealer never put on customer list for repair i even called denver dealer myself and complained told normal every time  over   years noise increased  now car wont start and noise now sounds like an old diesel truck engine  i understand having trouble with a car but do not understand dealers protecting the bmw name by not completing what would be a very expensive repair while under warranty  do not buy bmw products  get over the looks and demand service
BMW,Service/Maintenance,nice but very fragile in  months after buying it i had to visit the dealership more times than in  years with my mitsubishi outlander something is constantly wrong with this car but the last drop was it failed to start for the second time when it was cold outside after half of the trip to the school with the baby i am no longer planning to keep it as it is simply unreliable yes it gets fixed for free but what about my time and the inconvenience now it is sitting at the dealership and will be there for  weeks until they get a part i am driving the loaner update  i had to get rid of this car only after  months of ownership i have traded it for new cadillac srx the primary reason was extremely low reliability it failed my wife twice in winter and she was stuck in cold for hours bmw roadside assistance was not answering calls for many hours clearly we were not alone  dealer tried to blame me for poor driver profile although even this is no true  i measured battery parameters and they were perfect not to mention that its been  years and cadillac works very well for my poor driver profilei still believe that i have not driven anything better than x in terms of quality of the ride and especially in winter but unfortunately this has little value if you cannot rely on the car
BMW,Service/Maintenance,reliability  reliability  reliability  its shocking that bmw cant make reliable car for the money they charge this wk will be my fourth visit to the dealership for drivers restraint malfunction  they dont seem to know whats going on with this car  i have seen similar reliability reviews and i just wonder in the engineers at bmw read them  its also statistically higher than other competitors or japanese cars
BMW,Engine/Performance,little red z fun car  if you are taller than  its a little tight
BMW,,juliewestlake
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,z   l this is the most legal fun you can have  the only complaint i have is about the horrible harmankardon speakers i have heard better in a vw beetle  there is no excuse for bmw to use this poor quality  it is one of those things you understand that you will just have to replace
BMW,Price/Value,rrz ive loaded mine up with the dinan
BMW,Engine/Performance,need for speed this cars fulfills the need i used to
BMW,Design/Style,"ugly car but fast as hell this car was extremely fast however it was one of the ugliest cars i have ever seen"
BMW,Service/Maintenance,never selling it  i purchased this car from a dealer in distress they got a shipment of zs in december  they had snow drifts up to  feet and the zs were not selling  i got the car delivered to my home  miles away for about   of what the local dealers were getting for this car  in a little over  years of ownership no problems yet  i get offers to sell the car every time i take it out

BMW,Price/Value,its all a lie i will never buy or lease a bmw way overrated and its a money pit
BMW,Price/Value,unreliable pos if you want an unreliable car this is for you  timing chain snaps at k  six months later stranded again cause the steering lock mechanism failed  gotta tow that pos again  ive only been stranded twice in the last  years  both times bmw im going back to japanese reliability and will never buy or recommend bmw
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,i lover my bmw my first german car and the moment i test drove this car i felt how the handling was so tight on a open highway i feel free as a bird cold weather pkg makes this care a breeze to use on those cold days heated seats steering wheel dual zones meant no fighting between me and my wife who is always cold no matter what type of weather it is in new york i purchased this car as an early retirement gift but i keep getting in it despite own  other vehicles for commuter cars all i can say over all this bmw is off the hook and a attention getter on the road or parked
BMW,Comfort/Interior,xi wagon review the car is solid but the front seat is a bit deep and the back of your legs at the knee will touch the seat and forces you to slouch forward for clearance or inflate the lumbar support feature to move you forward and clear the behind the knee issues you see for a  adult like me and my wife is  foot even the rear seats are too deep and makes small adult legs float and not reach the carpet which makes your legs numb after awhile  but the car is solid handler so it washes out
BMW,Price/Value,unload it before the warranty expires  i bought my i automatic with around k miles first off do not believe bmw that the auto trans fluid is lifetime fluid mine was black in color theres no such thing i used to do  of my maintenance until i bought this car had to have a shop do the trans  i did the front brakes  at around k it was one issue after another at k at  mph the trans downshifts into th gear the idrive states that there is a trans malfunction code had the codes checked and the car was diagnosed with a bad trans for a used one  i loved driving the car and the mpg but way to expensive to maintain after warranty is out i lost  in the  months that i owned it
BMW,Engine/Performance,worst car ive ever owned beautiful looking but leaves you stranded the only thing this car has going for it is looks the car is a worthless piece of crap in my opinion i bought it with  miles and a month later the car died it needed a new battery and had  worth of oil leaks my mechanic told me the oil leaks are standard maintenance on this bmw a week later the car wouldnt start again  threw a check engine light it needed a new thermostat coolant and maf sensor two weeks later i discovered another oil leak at the oil pressure sensor this is ridiculous ive owned a  toyota from  miles all the way to  miles and it never needed a new battery never had oil leaks never a check engine light and it never left me stranded
BMW,Comfort/Interior,love  hate i love and hate this car the signalers still drive me nuts there is no temperature gauge cabin storage cant set the radio because of the stupid idrive cup holders from hell cant see the speedometer through the steering wheel setting the climate control is almost impossible idrive again nothing about the controls is intuitive i previously drove an infiniti which practically drove itself  that said i have never driven a car that handles anywhere as well as this bmw i just give me an open road a valentine  radar detector and i am a very happy boy i have owned this car for over  years and have no plans to trade or sell it i hope to put another  miles on it
BMW,Engine/Performance,transmission fault transmission fault came on and then i have to stop in the middle of the road to restart for light would go off  this is the worst bmw ever the car only have k  and my friends has a kia with more miles and there no problems with his car even the bmw shop tried to fix the car but they fix the wrong thing i hate i ever got this car
BMW,Price/Value,this is not what you want to buy i dont know whats going on with this cars the noise inside my car is never ending we brought it to the dealer several times to replace the seals on the four doors acceleration is very very extremely poor in the i you can not pass a car in the city and mine is standard transm my ac always smells so bad that i always prefer driving with my windows down for the price you pay no way this is a k car i drive very poor
BMW,Comfort/Interior,looks can be decieving i bought the car in germany and couldnt wait to get it back to the states the same week it arrived i had to turn it into the dealership because the monitor said i was out of oil they fixed that problem a couple of months past and one night the car went crazy windshield wipers wouldnt turn off headlights radio interior lights were all flashing bmw claimed to fix the problem  weeks later i was at the dealership again for another software issue my vehicle had been in the shop  times and was less than a year old i was really disappointed with the way bmw corporate handled the situation i could have purchased a neon and had less problems i wont be purchasing another bmw
BMW,Design/Style,instrumentation disaster this idrive thing is an abomination  my minivan radio has more capabilities the idrive has a nice color screen looks cool but essentially does nothing  really shockingly disfunctional and distracts from the overall driving experience  it constantly displays a warning that essentially says dont look at this while your driving  if i cant upgrade this thing i think im going to trade it in  really really disappointed
BMW,Engine/Performance,green machine the sports package tires and rims do not meet the rough roads potholesetc expect out of pocket costs new tiresnew rims potentially after  miles out of pocket costs could near    also three recalls to date which are not what i expected in a k vehicle   cupholders are terrible
BMW,Comfort/Interior,a dangerous lemon i obtained this my third bmw with enthusiasm  unfortunately the car was a lemon from an electrical standpoint with multiple problems from the start  the worst were that the heated seat burned through the seat leather and burned through my clothes and into my wallet which was all that saved me  now the seat is under recall  next the assisted steering system failed on the freeway  i have returned the car most unsatisfied
BMW,Comfort/Interior,the i is definitely not a sports sedan build quality was fine but it is sluggish and slow and has no feel for the road   it lacks the exciting driving feel youd expect in a bmw  the turbo  is inadequate and leaves the car underpowered and wanting   the navigation system still requires  a lot of patience  its not intuitive    the tires have been a disappointment they started cupping in front at  miles   unfortunately the car drives like an underpowered buick or ford taurus rental   if id wanted a buick i would have bought one for  less    very disappointed   ive owned six bmws and this is by far the worst   believe the new redesign in  is intended to remedy many of the cars faults   as soon as i can im going to dump this dog
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,poor gas milage bought this car  weeks ago gas milage is  city sticker says  called the dealer they said  is normal well why advertise  plus ventilation system is on every time you start the car even if you dont want it on
BMW,Design/Style,distorted rear window images handsome car however potential safety hazard  images are distorted through the rear window when driving at night thought the problem was related to poor tint job from dealership at first  had tint removed and problem still exists sad news is that dealership vista motors  insists they have never encountered this problem any advice would be helpful
BMW,Price/Value,transmission problem once the  year k miles warranty is gone surprises maintenance very expensive and for those equipped with lifetime zf hp transmission youll be lucky if it last past k mark especially in new england weather
BMW,Engine/Performance, bmw i sedan this is our first bmw which we bought new with  miles on the odometer and its still going strong after  years and  miles we average  miles per week on it backforth to work highway gas mileage averages  mpg my wife loves the car and i hope it lasts another k miles weve had no engine problems but regular maintenance is expensive our dealer had to repair the moon roof  times due to the guide rails  kept breaking fortunately those repairs were under warranty and we solved that problem by not using the moon roof anymore the led dash display burns out and is very expensive to replace  my mechanic tells me this is a known defect that bmw will not acknowledge
BMW,Design/Style,electronic problems we picked up a cpo i just off of lease records were clean  initially car lived up to the bmw standards  months in the electrical system started going haywire sensors  has been a pain ever since it has gotten to the point i contacted the ceo of bmwag in germany very disappointed they threw it back on dealer it is the mfg fault not the dealer at present working with dealer to roll out into another dealer is being very helpful  i hope for a resolution soon other than this the car is what you expect from a bmw
BMW,Comfort/Interior,"sportswagon review my kids cant understand why i have a wagon instead of a big suv i can park any where low center of gravity and its a sports car with a big trunk"

BMW,Price/Value,disatified owner i owe a  bmw i this car has been nothing but trouble since i got it it breaks down without warning only to find out it can not be towed because the vehicle cannot be put in neutral the car has to be put on a lift to deactivate the transmission which cannot be down when you are stranded dont waste your time with this vehicle it looks great but not dependable not worth the price or inconvience
BMW,Engine/Performance, major failures in k miles im the first and current owner of a  series bmw the car has had the following failures  power train tie rods turbo charger engine tuneup oil filter housing and coolant system weve had the car towed twice and have had the car in the dealership a half dozen times for repairs weve escalated to bmw usa but they have refused to provide any additional assistance  save yourself the trouble
BMW,Service/Maintenance,run flat tires will fail  bmw  low miles but already  run flat tires have failed on me sidewalls splitting  effectively destroying tire the left front tire has been replaced three times unfortunately bmw does not stock these tires so when it falls apart your car will be in shop  days while they order new tire motorwerks in minneapolis does not have any loaner cars when this happens so consider your bmw a  bus pass you will be taking the bus a lot not a fan of run flats  what are you supposed to do when the sidewall splits and you are  miles from home in the middleofnowhere  give me a spare bmw

BMW,Service/Maintenance,buyer beware i had  cars sitting in my garage one was a bmw i  one is a gmc envoy  and the other is a toyota tacoma truck the bmw continued to leak oil all over the garage until i finally sold itthe envoy and the tacoma have about  miles each and i doubt that i have even spent  combined on the  of these cars since i have owned themthe bmw has been nothing but problems with every maintenance bill being at least  just a battery alone for the car is almost the car was the best driving car i have ever owned but reliability was the worst of any of the  cars i have owned since i first started drivingi traded it recently for a toyota
BMW,Engine/Performance,brake booster failure with k miles i am very disappointed to drive with a supposedly quality build car just to figure out it started to fail breaking while waiting in the car line to pick up my children unbelievable i needed a full replacement of the brake booster and the brake master cylinder after only k miles good luck to all of you driving this car which almost became a liability for me that will be my first and last bmw ever
BMW,Design/Style,stay away from i great handling but there it ends one of the most unreliable cars ive owned and ive had italian cars some of the problems the dealer has been unable to fix because they are fundamentally flawed radio because of terrible computer in the car transmission shifts if you need to find it look in the shop
BMW,Comfort/Interior,from cl to bmw  having come out of a cl  merc i found the bm only slightly slower  the bms road holding is better however its economy is the same as the bhp merc  the bm is a boring drive but i can live with that  i miss my tv and seat heating
BMW,Price/Value,is it a lemon took ownership end of feb less than  hours later the car said i had a flat had to wait  day to diagnose myself and reset a week later the computer reboots while doing the voice commands a week or two after that navigation tells me im driving in the ocean took it in and a week later its fixed but after the sw upgrade the computer rebooted twice after it went to sleep a  days locking the car doesnt blink the lights nor chimes intermitent going up the hill it feels like it wants to stall but doesnt and now the latest steering wheel is pointing right  i feel like im driving a very expensive very poorly designed car  current mileage
BMW,Price/Value,flashy but weak car is not reliable at all high maintenance cost frequent mechanical visits parts expensive rear leg room is terrible brake are loud  dusty electric issues are often
BMW,Engine/Performance, months in service  years owned where do i begin its a pos in the  years i owned i cant say its a high performance vehicle because i have always driven it with an existing problem usually two problems at once started with the tires that came on vehicle factory recommended run flats that were causing vibration did alignment issue continued replaced tires issue went away partially because the boots needed to be replaced water pump failed flat bed truck towed  thousands later intermittent power reduction while driving replaced two spark plugs and two coil overs valve decarb recommended  replaced two spark plugs and two coil overs no youre not seeing double nor triple because power reduction again and rpms all over the place replaced both bank    turbos k to find out it was the clutch its a  speed manual not the turbos dealer could care less ive never seen a car leak oil like this its ridiculous they replaced the oil housing  times pretty much every oil change you replaced some major part another power reduction issue caused by broken gasket replaced that one too this car promises hp it never delivered because it always had an issue the boot of the car contains all the electronics a water bottle i had in trunk leaked and again power reduction vehicle undriveable  to fix tpms sensor like what does that have to do with engine power and they had to reset the whole car battery replacement  has to be programmed i swear they didnt make any of this up the dealer but they might as well have read around all  bmws have major issues like this the list goes on but i am at a loss for words
BMW,Service/Maintenance,no issues    maybe im lucky i seem to have gotten the opposite of lemon got the car as a cpo and drive it about k miles a year combined city and hwy driving i have done zero maintenance other than brakes once tires three tes and oil changes every k miles the only caveat is this car will chew through tires  youll get about k out of a set no matter what you buy  and because of the awd you have to replace all  at once it drives like a dream  especially on the back roads after a snowstorm once the seal around the rear window got dislodged and water got in the trunk and down into the well under the spare bmw stupidly put some electronics there and the tpm monitor control until got wet and shorted out i dug it out of there dried it off and let it et in a bag of rice of for a day or two plugged it back in and it worked fine
BMW,Design/Style, beemer
BMW,Price/Value,not nearly enough bang for your buck considering the steep price this vehicle is mostly a disappointment  at k miles the water pump went  shortly afterward three injectors failed  at k miles the lower bushings needed replacing  while the vehicle is fun to drive much of my experience has been quite pedestrian  needless to say my next vehicles will be a mercedes and an audi as my wife will be getting a new vehicle next year as well  the ultimate driving machine needs to be examined more closely in terms of reliability
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,poor reliability  expensive to fix great car when it is work  kmiles second owner bought at  k so far i replaced water pump turboshift assembly battery  one bearing  low pressure fuel pump if you have the money for this buy it if notno the only way i will buy an other bmw will be only if has  cpo warranty
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,fun to drive poor reliability  expensive to fix this was my st and last bmw bought the car new in the  years and k miles ive owned the car i had afaulty battery bad fuel pump dead oxygen sensor and a failed water pumpi was stranded  times car completely died and almost stranded twice so multiple trips to the shops and over  grand of repair bills later i have finally gave up on this ultimate driving machine it was a fun car to drive while it worked but for a k car id expect bmw to deliver something better the worst part is that i totally lost my confidence in it and can no longer feel comfortable taking this car on any extended trips this will be the last bmw i ever spend my money on
BMW,Price/Value,overcomplicated  unreliable my  xi has  miles on it there always seems to be something going wrong with it every few monthsit has been one of the most unreliable cars ive ever owned but when it is working it is a blast to drive even the simplest repairs are ridiculously expensive and you are often forced to going to the dealer as most independent shops cannot work with the bmw computer systemi dont know what they were thinking when they designed idrive it takes an engineering degree to change radio stations through idrive i guess over engineering is the bmw waythis will probably be my st and last bmw
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,buy it ive driven this car daily for  years and i still look for excuses to go drive it some more simply a blast after testing all the other makes and models of audi acura infinity etc i still say this theres no comparison to how much better this car drives the fuel pump issue people discuss is silly bmw continues to cover this even out of warranty my dealer replaced mine without me mentioning it when i was in for an oil change ive had zero trouble with this car knock on wood and i drive it really hard
BMW,Comfort/Interior,issues and bad design for very basic features i bought a cpo   xi a year and half ago and have had quite a few issues that i think i shouldnt have for a car that is  years oldthe driver side sport seat stopped working correctly a couple months ago my battery died  to replace thatyou cannot do it yourselfit needs to be paired with the electrical devices in the carthis week my ac went outturns out there was a leak in the ac system and while my car was getting repaired they discovered a leak in my transmissionthe tires that dont go flat cannot be repairedbe prepared to buy a new tire and hope they have one in stock or you are out of commission until they get one
BMW,Comfort/Interior,too many problems just to start this is not my first car or my secondi understand there are no guarantees in life and cars are finnickysometimes you just get a bad applebut for the  a i costs those apples should be fixed properly and the owner satisfiedi have owned quite a few vehicles in my now  years of driving of which were a  xi and a  i sportboth of which had no problemsi purchased the i in  with k milesit was a cpo which gave me comfort purchasing a used carnot any morei seriously doubt this car was properly inspectedwhich is what i told bmw and they passed the buck to the dealer who basically told me f offconsistent problems
BMW,Engine/Performance, series death trap see nhtsagov i was not aware there were so many engine issues with these models while accelerating into high speed traffic my vehicle stopped suddenly the engine stalled power steering quit car was rendered useless i barely made it off the road when my car finally came to rest after doing research into safecargov ive found that this is an unfortunate problem that bmw will not officially recall it seems as if its because they cant offer a permanent fix for the issue im reading that dealerships keep bandaging up major engine failure because bmw na is not giving them further help regarding this particular engine praying that no one must die for the govt to intervene  for bmw to fix this
BMW,Engine/Performance,charge me in all the recent reviews of this modeli do not see the most exasperating quality of its day to day performance i refer to the battery drain when parkedthe first winter i used the cari did not start it for about  weeks since i do not drive on salted roads the display had suffered a reset which happens when the battery voltage gets too low i received a statement from bmw that the car must be driven at least  miles daily to avoid this reset happeningi am retired and use the car mainly for shorter distancesless than  milesas a result i have to connect a sustaining charger every  or  days to keep the volts up  annoying and apparently still needed on the s
BMW,Engine/Performance,st bmw well i had been driving a  volvo so the   is a major treat unbelievable in the workmanship performance and handling i hope to always drive a bmw  it just hugs the corners when driving cant wait to try it on a calif hwy like hwy  in half moon bay
BMW,Service/Maintenance,a wagon thats a sports car previously owned a mercedes e class wagon and this is a totally different experience i do find myself still comparing the two vehicles i think the mercedes seats have more support and my biggest disappointment with the bmw is the turning circle which is not nearly as tight as the merc  getting used to the idrive but i still think theres too much confusing and unnecessary engineering in these newage vehicles
BMW,Design/Style,best car ever i owned this car for about  years since new i knew nothing about cars and this was perhaps the most poorly treated neglected car you can ever imagine yet it was lower maintenance than my current japanese reliable car which i follow service schedule to the letter the worst problem was at  years when squirrels ate through wires during a year of just sitting the mechanic changed some fluids replaced some seals under k total with all the squirrel damage so i stupidly was the worst car owner ever yet the car was perfect i only sold because i needed money for move and didnt need a car but from day  this was the best driving experience i have ever experienced it felt like there was no car there in a good way like i was completely connected with road the seats made my lower back hurt beyond belief after a long trip yet i happily put up with this pain because of the driving experience except winter without snow tires it was a really bad car in the snow the cup holders as everyone has commented on were beyond bad they broke in the first year and barely held a drink even when the flimsy arms were functioning should be in a museum of bad design it had other quirks the steeringwhealkey would randomly lock frequently during attempts to start itsometimes i wondered if i was going to get going but always did i even miss these quirks seriously when i got it people said it would be constant problems and unreliable and maybe i just got lucky or this car is a masochist but it was so reliable and the mpg it got was insane i think even better than advertised crazy
BMW,Engine/Performance,worst car ive ever had drives great when its not being repaired which is every other week ill take a honda with all upgrades over an  over priced over rated bmw sell before warranty expires or be ready to empty your wallet
BMW,Price/Value,fun to drive not to pay for torque out the kazoo lots of grunt for passing throw it in to corners as hard as you want  i regularly drove the car on mi trips and was very comfortable at the end  however exceptionally expensive maintenance has been a downer  i spent over  incl  to replace a window motor in  mos and could be spending another  as the car has k mi  will not buy another bmw wo warranty and probably not with warranty until idrive tumor is removed
BMW,Price/Value,terrible reliability i bought a certified bmw and had nothing but problems since i bought it  i have had three different severe problems with the cooling system alone and this is with a car with only  miles on it  all three cooling system problems happened three weeks after my certified maintenance expired and each cost approx  to fix and left me stranded  this car drives nice and is fast and all but mechanically it is a nightmare and it totally unreliable  and again it was a certified car when i bought it  beware  bmw service like brakes and regular service is expensive   just for front brakes which you need every  miles or so  i am not happy and getting rid of the car
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,"great car i bought my bmw  back in  and have enjoyed it a lot over the past  years i had a few repairs so far the worst was the breakdown of the board computer after   years which set me back about"
BMW,Price/Value,i cant part with it ive owned a   ia w sport pkg
BMW,Engine/Performance,"just what the dorctor ordered having trst driven everything in this class that mercedes audi lexus and jaguar had to offer i returned to the  with open arms the speed stickshift just clinched it for me every time the m had not yet been released and at keri dont think so"
BMW,Price/Value, all that a perfermormance sedan can
BMW,Price/Value,"upgrade to newer year i just moved up from my  to a  iaso sweet  i was looking at new nissan altimas used volvo ss and infinity gs bottom line  they are not the ultimate drivig machine buy a ceritifed used vehicle beat on the dealer do your homework on price tmv with edmunds and look at car  drivers websote as well as kelly blue book on line sell your used car and take advantage of bmw financing im in at   months  you will not be sorry"
BMW,Price/Value,highmaintenance  e doesnt age well the cooling system is sure to fail by k  radiator water pump and more front end likely shot by that mileage rear end suspension too all kinds of leaks power steering transmission hoses all the vacuum tubes get extremely brittle and disintegrate when you touch them  the vanos system is likely shot by that mileage decreasing mpg and power automatic tranny replaced at k  basically just ridiculous how such an expensive car can have reliability of a s ford its a true ford car fixorrepairdaily
BMW,Engine/Performance,nice car i bought the car used and had a little trepidation about the reliability of the car the exterior design of this car is unbeatable bar none i have the performance  inch wheels and the ride is harsh to say the least the road noise from the tires are too loud but the car looks and runs so well that i can overlook those few faults also i have to take into account that the car is six years old
BMW,Comfort/Interior,love this car but my wife had a new baby and bought this car  we love the carits fun to drive and realiable but find it difficult to put a baby in a car seat and it does not have the extra hooks to tie down a car seat  the drink holders are the worst i have ever seen we need to move on to a the mini van and forget about getting another bmw
BMW,Design/Style,beemer shmeemer about k sensors fail
BMW,Comfort/Interior,trade it before it goes out of warranty i own a  i purchased in  with k miles after k interior cooling fan burned out and short circuited my electronics  rear door gaskets went bad  transmission failed  used had to replace the guibo passenger window regulator replaced then drivers window regulator failed within  yrs drivers side failed againinner and outer tie rods have been replaced  times both seat motors no longer work windshield wiper motor burned out twice fan clutch failed of course the cup holders broke before k and radio display you cant readeven doing the majority of the work myself the car is a money pit now i have k and want to sell it no characters left to list all   finally got rid of that headache thank god
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,suprised at the poor quality from bmw ive owned my bwm for  years and have been disappointed with the reliability and the quality of the interiorthe cupholders broke early on because they are cheap plasticthere are controls on the panel that are falling apartthe lcd panel is almost completely burned out and i cant see what radio station or time it iseven the odometer and gas mileage readout is starting to burn outbmw told me it would be about  to fix iti am so surprised that a  car doesnt have better quality materialsi have also been disappointed with the reliabilitylast year i spent about  on repairsi wont buy another bwm
BMW,Price/Value,buy the extended warranty bought the car with k on it  within a week it had a complete electronic failure and lost all systems fortunately it was under warranty  since then have has several expensive repairs expansion tank radiator alternator secondary cooling fan and miscellaneous other repairs always over  per visit  nice car but always something breaking
BMW,Comfort/Interior,it works for me lower front bumper takes all the punishment due to sport suspension one cannot be careful enough when parking in a space where the car is driven into a stall  due to the sport suspension any curbing higher then four  inches will catch on the bumper and potentially cause damage  my damage to date has resulted in an  repair bill  other then that the car meets all my expectations and is a pleasure to drive
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,you are what you drive the  bmw i with premium  sports
BMW,Price/Value,expensive fun my expectations of this car have been
BMW,Comfort/Interior,"save your money reading the other reviewsi wonder if i was sold a completely different car firstthe seats are so deeply contoured that the left bolster interferes with comfortable shifting my leg goes to sleep after about  minutes if i get the steering wheel in a comfortable place i can no longer see the instrument panel the shifter is sloppy and the clutch has no definite point of engagement the upper gear ratios are so close that it is hard to tell which gear i am in combined with that is the fact that st gear is so tall that i am at redline not much above  mph"
BMW,Service/Maintenance,disappointing given the uniformly positive reviews on the e body series i was prepared to love this car  but it has been so disappointing that im considering selling it after five months of ownership  the problem is simple  and no its not the cupholders which i agree are flimsy but they dont bother me  its the constant and apparently unfixable creaks squeaks and rattles from the doors the rear hatch the seats etc  ive had it in at the dealer several times  also disappointing is the junky sound of the doors when slammed closed  of the about  cars ive owned this is one of the biggest bucket of bolts of the lot  if i could go back in time i would not have bought this car
BMW,Engine/Performance,reliable  i bought my  bmw i with about  miles on it it now has  on it i have not had any major problem but little ones here and there for a while the car would just cut off at a stop light or in the drive way or anywhere when you hit the gas it always started right back up but it started getting worse and worse nobody could tell me what was wrong with it because it didnt have any engine lights on one day it cut off and the service engine soon light came on it turned out to be the camshaft posision sensor now it runs like its brand new had a bad oil leak but only cost me  to get fixed cup holders are broke and the wheels get break dust on them pretty bad
BMW,Engine/Performance,numerous mechanical issues i have heard that these cars were very reliable mine was extremely fun to drive but had numerous mechanical issues maybe i just got a bad one had to replace the drive shaft in the first year drive belt tensioner exploded causing loss of power steering and cut hose resulted in overheat right front suspension replacement required before k miles not driven very hard numerous other issues final stage unit caused air conditioning to fail replaced twice during time i owned etc
BMW,Design/Style,stay in the shop this cars style and lines are beautiful inside and out  it handles like a champ on the road when its not in the shop seems like the cold weather always creates problems for it ie tensioners go bad noises get louder  while at the shop the problem can never be duplicated on the first visit  it takes at least two visits to the shop to get it repaired they never have the broken part in stock also the car is not as quiet as i would expect from a high end vehicle  my frequent visits to the service dept and the noises continually reduce my opinion of my i if you buy one make sure it is certified so your out of pocket expenses will be minimal
BMW,Price/Value,this car simply rocks i have always been an m guy and took a chance to have something for the family  it is a blast  you feel as if you are driving literally one of the finest automobiles in the world but buy it to drive and drive hard  save the lex or merc for the softies
BMW,Comfort/Interior," i with premiumxenon bought my  i after a few months of research but dealer left a bad taste the car is fun to drive and looks awesome but seems to require regular visits to the shop for various issues like radio cup holders wipers bulbs etc the dealer experience is terrible  i have tried  different dealers over  years and it is the only major regret i have enough to make be go to another brand for my next car poor handling in snow front bumper is low enough to require frequent visits to the shop side and rear visibility is poor due to small mirrors and huge headrests"
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,the ultimate driving machine the coolest and classiest car ever
BMW,Engine/Performance,sensor headache i had owned this car for about  years now and it has been giving headaches with sensor lights coming on like christmas all year round  the most common lightsfailure is the odometer where asc abs engine check lights all comes on at once  when this happens the dealer charges an arm and a leg to have them fixed  most time it is the stupid asc module that failed which is an expensive equipment to replace  bmw dealerships repair are a repair  bunch of rip offs  they charge you by just talking to you   for a scan check then a few thousands for repairs  dont buy these cars if you cant handle stress
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,mpg awful cup holders with ac blowing on them  mine has  and just performs more gracefully with age  recommend you absolutely find a local garage that you trust and you will save at least half of dealer repairs  my mpg indicates  miles per gallon not not on liter scale  but i seem to be getting about  mpg which is not great for first time this week i used  instead of  at the pump and car is running beautifully
BMW,Engine/Performance,"bmw i sp this car is always a pleasure to drive and its stealth performance is there when you need it the body style and popularity of lesser series models doesnt turn heads but this car is made to thrill the driver not the bystanders cupholder criticisms aside the quality and durability is everything that its numerous awards suggest"
BMW,Comfort/Interior,"ulimate discomfort machine the sport seats have nearly crippled me  the seat cushion sags even under my moderate  lb frame this causes spine to flatten and forces a slouch position  the lumbar support tries to force your spine into normal curvature but it is poorly positioned hard as a rock and not adjustable  ive never been so pleased with a car and yet been unable to enjoy it due to the major discomfort of the seats  ive owned  cars and driven countless european japanese and american cars on business trips  ive never had a seat bother me before despite very long trips"
BMW,Engine/Performance,"riding a silver bullet this is definitely a drivers car  myonly complaint is that i should havegotten the sports package youdefinitely get the lookies fromother luxury car drivers  the torqueieengine makes the car feel a lot fasterthan it really is but at cruisingspeeds the passing power of this carcan be felt and seen by those in yourrear view mirror all you have to do isnudge on the gas a bit  all withouthaving to downshift like other cars this is after all a car meant for theautobahn where everyone drives likespeed racer"
BMW,Engine/Performance,poor engine design my first bmw to be the last expensive replacement parts engine head that sits on the engine block is made of an alloy that cant be refurbished has to be replaced with a new  when the head goes oil seeps into the coolant ruining the coolant system  when the head is replaced the bock is damaged and has to be replaced the bolts for mounting head onto the block often damage the block thus making it obsolete  read internet response to this particular model overheating  its a shame bmw hasnt addressed the issue nor recall the poorly design head
BMW,Engine/Performance, wagon wagons driving performance is
BMW,,bmw i
BMW,Price/Value,big bucks german bad transmission cheap parts bought newminor problems while under warranteesince then replaced rear wheel bearing at ktransmission slam from second to first like getting hit from behindbmw engineers created a computer work around for this common problem but will not fix this default and you must pay dealer whether it works or notmany people being talked into replacing transmission for kcheap dash components like cup holders and ashtray flimsy had to replace both two timesfor the price paid quality is severely lackingwould not recommend buying a used onelocal dealer repair shop is horriblehad vehicle  days on two occasions without fixingbmw regional tech changed battery hrs
BMW,Engine/Performance,my last bmw this is the familys th bmw in yrs i gave up a low miles  i sport to upgrade  there was a reason why someone traded it in with only k miles on it  it shakes and shudders while idling the traction control goes berserk around corners no pick up drives like my grandmas volvo s which was a fraction of the cost the bmw svc ctr says its a flaw in the engine that makes it shudder bmwna says no such flaw and now the svc ctr is angry that i called bmwna and i cant get a diagnosis  this is insane for a car that initially sold for k with the prem  cold weather pkg never again if i want a volvo sedan ill buy one
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,xi review this car is the best performing automobile that ive ever owned  with that being said it is the worst car ergonomically that ive ever seen  the idrive system is a total disaster  just trying to change the heatac is actually dangerous when driving because you must use the isdrive to do it  almost all setting on this car must be changed through the idrive which is very finicky
BMW,Comfort/Interior,bmws worst ill start with the positive the car is fun to drive  now the negatives there are several fatal design flaws that make ownership a real pain  for example the six disk changers cartridge is at the back of the glove box and only accessible from the passenger seat with all the glove box contents emptied  the center consoles is hard to access provides limited space and lacks a power outlet or ipod connection  unexplainably there are two power outlets for the back seat passengers  idrive is useless  for a simply function like shifting the air vent from the dash to the feet it takes a dozen clicks   the  series is a classic and the  is luxury but the  is downright useless
BMW,Engine/Performance, i disappointment i have taken the car back  times in a little over a year for repairs i am very disappointed with bmw and will not buy another the day i picked the car up i had to return it because the sos system was not working idrive went out the sunroof had to be repaired to work correctly warning for high battery drain  times window antitrap warning rough idle
BMW,Price/Value,a little pain for lots of fun gain in the market for a car in  and for the price of a boring accord v k in canada i got a xit cpo with  km on ithad to deal with electronic glitches here and there tire sensors oil level sensors etc and the transmission is somehow brutal when accelerating from a red lightalso experience problems at idle irregular rpmsbut all covered by cpo warrantydriving is a blast i put  km on it annually and wouldnt want to drive any other car month if i could afford a  mb e matic station i could consider a trade but even if i need to rebuild the tranny it will still be cheaper and more fun to drive my xit into the groundk km heading for k
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,st time bmw ownerbad experience my husband bought this car for my th birthday this was a bad gift  ive had my car in the shop  times multiple times for brakes and wheelstires  the car has been in the shop  times in the last two and half months  i will never buy another bmw i want to be able to get in my car and drive without wondering if my caliper will fall off
BMW,Engine/Performance,not the ultimate driving machine this is a great car for performance and driving dynamics this is not a good car for reliability quality and running costs ive had countless check engine lights failed window regulators excessive oil consumption failed steering pump failed abs sensors premature headlight failures transmission shuddering egv failure and few electronic issues in the interior components many of these issues were covered under warranty however the amount of time spent in and out of the dealer was ridiculous some repairs like the transmission shudder couldnt be remedied this is the worst car ive owned in terms of reliability its the worst in maintaining its value i sold it at a loss but im very glad that i did
BMW,Price/Value,stereo is not good i didnt get the high end stereo package and it has really minimized my affection for the car at k this stereo sounds similar to a much less expensive car shame on you bmw
BMW,Engine/Performance,unreliable i bought a  i xdrive used at  currently have  miles on it  i would expect some things to break at this mileage but this is ridiculous  i had to replaced the water pump in march and the starter in september then i got a message saying fuel pump on the screen and car would shut down  bmw replaced the electonic fuel pump on the way home i got the exact same message and car shut down  bmw then replaced the mechanical fuel pump and again car shut off with same warning  bmw then replaced the ekps module now i get an engine malfunctionreduce power message and i feel like im in a semitruck  cant wait to see what bmw says on monday
BMW,Engine/Performance,oh the problems ive seen the direct fuel injectors have introduced a new and not insignificant problem to the engine coke formation is extensive those engine lights that start to light up anytime after say k miles are likely due to carbon buildup in the cylinders with the sensors going crazy as a result big engine lights  little engine lights single and multiple cylinders dropping out at highway speeds ltft abnormalities o sensor malfunction codes cylinder misfiring codes and on and onyou can spend many an hour chatting with your local mechanic getting to know all about his kids and their little league activities before you get to the necessary therapy walnut shell cylinder coke blasting
BMW,Engine/Performance, engine breakdowns already fuel pump replaced twice once before recall once aftercar lost power in two life threatening situations with children in carmost recent engine issue has put me in a compact rental car for two weeks while car continues to confuse technicians
BMW,Engine/Performance,problems arise just before the  mile mark i noticed oil drips on my garage floor i made a service appointment and the next day after being out overnite in a snowstorm it had a hard time starting and then driving at speed the engine malfunction  reduce power warning lite came on we were near a bmw dealer so stopped there  they diagnosed the engine warning as a fuel pressure sensor failure and they could not precisely diagnose the oil leak saying that the transmission will have to be removed to see where it is leaking the work  requires sending pictures and documentation to germany for repair authorization so i can expect to be without the car for up to a week unacceptable reliability
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmw fan disappointed this is my third bmw the car handles as expected and offers the joy and experience bmw owners have come to expect  however the reliability on this vehicle is unacceptable  first i had a fuel pump failure  i noticed several slow starts took it in and they found a fault with the fuel pump  next i was accelerating hard when the engine lost power and the message engine malfunction reduced power displayed   so far the dealer things its a software issue  i love these cars but reliability is subpar  if bmw doesnt resolve their reliability issues i purchased my last one
BMW,Engine/Performance,no substitute needed a wagon for its utility value  wanted the bmw for its performance and fun value  this vehicle delivers in both departments  i look forward to driving to work and sometimes take the long route home to spend a few more minutes behind the wheel  this car simply kills the suv on drivability  too bad most americans look at wagons as their grandparents cars
BMW,Engine/Performance,great looking horrible reliability n engine this car is absolutely fantastic in execution the majestic styling terrific handling and fantastic materials otherwise its a reliability nightmare everything that can go wrong with this car can and has the v engine has tremendous power but has nightmarish reliability woes ie timing chain issues valve stem seals pcv issues burning a quart of oil every  milesetc steer clear of this cat i wish i had oh yeah horrible fuel economy
BMW,Engine/Performance,n engine is nothing but trouble this is a bad engine google it constant engine light issues of crankcase failure these messages are related to bad engine parts like fuel injectors and sensors i had to replace head cover gaskets turbo pan gaskets and other gaskets car is a repair nightmare  only k miles and way too many problems unreliable
BMW,Engine/Performance, bmw i engine goes at  miles i purchased my  bmw i new from the dealer with only  miles  service has always been timely and performed only by bmw dealer  recently the car started making a rattling noise intermittently when accelerating and decelerating so i took the car into the dealer  i was informed that the engine had metal in it and needed to be replaced at a cost of   bmw is refusing to replace the engine and is only willing to cover  of the cost  metal in the engine is not something that i could have caused  the engine is either defected or the service that i thought was being performed on my car for the last  years has not been performed by the dealer or if done perhaps  incorrectly  ill never buy another bmw after this experience  bmw obviously does not stand behind its produce  so much for the ultimate driving machine
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,jet
BMW,Engine/Performance,buyer beware if youre considering buying this car please look into the n customer care program for this car there are about  engine components that were essentially recalled depending on when or if your i went through this program will determine the number of components you may have had replaced initially bmw changed out these components one at a time and each time you had a check engine light come on the would replace the next most commonly malfunctioning part eventually they started flat out replacing all the components since they would eventually fail i believe due to the heat and pressure they are placed under with the twin turbo  this added up to owners paying for their vehicle while they spent months in the shop while bmw did cover the costs of the replacement and extend the warranty having engine issue undoubtedly will lead to transmission issues this was the case of the most recent i owner i met at an german auto shop while getting another vehicle pre purchase inspected he said he spend over k on transmission work and eventual replacement while he owned the vehicle for only  months  of those months was spent in the shop these repair costs were not covered by bmw   some sleazy owners will not mention this programissue at all to you when selling the car which was what happened in my case luckily the deal fell through in the th hour at the bank when the vehicle failed state inspection due to worn out tires and brakes in this case owner claimed that both tires and brakes were replaced within the last  months some owners and used car salesmen are doing whatever they can to u load these problematic vehicles buyer beware
BMW,Comfort/Interior,complete disappointment  rft tires are nightmare i purchased this car in may it is now october and im returning the car to the dealer and taking the loss on the taxes and extended warranty i paid for to trade it in for a different car almost  down the drain plus whatever amount that car has devalued from use first of all let me just confirm the complaints about the tires i see from other reviewers they are a total nightmare i have the receipts for  tires that i have replaced in the last  months i bought  brand new tires at almost  bucks each after my first two flats  had a bubble and subsequently popped within  hours of having it installed i had it replaced with a new tire using the road hazard warranty and within a week the two front tires blew out again at that point i was driving scared and being extremely careful not to hit any bumps ive owned  door coupes with  wheels and thin tires and never had this problem i even tried getting tires with a bigger sidewall to see if the extra cushioning would help and it only made things worse the car started to have an issue with the transfer case according to the dealership the car has to use the specific tire measurements that come with the car or the transfer case gets confused when doling out power to the wheels so basically i had no choice but to keep replacing the crappy run flat tires that costs  ludicrous i am trading in the car because the money i will lose from purchasing the extended warranty  does not add up to the cost of constantly replacing these tires other issues i had in my short time with the car arethe windshield fluid stopped working and pump had to be replaced idrive controller completely stopped working so the entire infotainment system was uncontrollable driver seat kept causing a warning that it could not be calibrated radio kept having a strange feedback noise at high volumesall of these problems are minor issues that could easily be fixed by the very attentive and pleasant bmw staff at the service center they were great and very pleasurable to work with however it takes a month just to get an appointment at any bmw dealer in the new york area and some dealerships dont offer loaners unless you purchased the car from them  when i went to the service center i was shocked they had over a  cars on the lot for repairs ive never seen anything like it i previously had an infiniti and never had to wait for a service appointment or worry about getting a loaner not to mention the inifiniti facilities are infinitely no pun intended better than anything ive seen from bmw to say that im disappointed is an understatement im trading the car in and trying out an audi a or a benz cls  hoping that other german car brands dont turn out to be all hype
BMW,Comfort/Interior,good riddance electric throttle  turbos  you never know what you were going to get or when you are going to get it  merging onto a highway was a stressful event  seats were uncomfortable  not enough leg room im  runflat tires were junk  developed bubbles and made for harsh ride  alloy wheels were so soft andor car was so heavy that it was not possible to keep the wheels round or in balance  hvac temperature control never worked right it always blows hot air  car handled like crap  the opposite of the ultimate driving machine  the car rolled so much during a turn  usually suddenly  that it was downright scary  car was way too heavy i was glad to trade it in
BMW,Engine/Performance,rip xi nice car albeit a bit overpriced however there is something seriously wrong with this engine  after about  miles still under warranty poof the engine blew up and caught fire  the problem started with a chassis stabilization malfunction error and the car went into limp mode where you cannot exceed mph  after a mile of driving car engine started to smoke up  after shutting off engine car engine eventually ignited  prior yo the fire i would receive random errors in the battery and noticed burning oil smell  anyway although i am a bmw lover im not sure i see a new bmw in my future unless bmw makes it right and incentivises me to buy another one
BMW,Service/Maintenance,poor tires equipped for the  series im a bmw fan and had several bmw cars bought or leased from bmw dealers before this i leased in sept  from nick alexander imports in la no problem with bmw cars before this i which we had replaced  run flat tires within  months of lease with the same probleminternal cuts on tires this is really unusual as i never had this tire issue with other bmw cars before i filed a complaint with the dealer from which i leased the car but was told driver was responsible for tires
BMW,Engine/Performance,lots of smiles  update just turned  milesafter reading other reviews im surprisednot a fan of run flats but the rears went  miles and i just changed the fronts yep   milesalso i have not had the car in for anything other than an oil changethe car has had zero defectsstill looks and handles like new and is a blast to drive spd manualif a single thing bugs me it is the phone booklets say you pull up a name and dial the house and there is no answerif you want to dial the same person only the cell you have to start from scratch imputting the name etc wish the back button worked just to take you to the other numbers for this same person
BMW,Engine/Performance,please read this if you are even considering buying a  this is our th bmw over a  year time spanit is our last bmwthe car shifts very poorly from a rolling stop and just poorly from a dead stop when i contacted bmw of na they were very defensive and did nothingthis car was over   and should shift without hesitation let the buyer beware this is a car i would not buy again and it is the last car i will buy from bmw
BMW,Price/Value,transmission problems this is my third bmw  series and im afraid its my last the transmission hestitation at low speeds is absolutely maddening its much worse than any turbo lag i wish i still had my  i ive taken it to the dealer three times and was told its just the nature of the beast and there is nothing we can do sure wish i would have read about the conerns posted here before i leased this car for  months four months and four thousand miles of misery doubt i can last my new bimmer is a bummer any ideas
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,average i have owned this car for a year and find it very averagethe steering is terrible and the transmission gear selection is also terriblethe rest is borderline averageit demonstrates very little value for the money its much to heavyits far from the ultimate driving machinenot much fun to drive
BMW,Price/Value,buyer beware i bought a  i xdrive in late  within the last six weeks i have had runflat tires on inch wheels go bust over fairly minor pot holes they were  unrelated incidents cost to replace just shy of last week my car with about  miles on the clock broke down on the highway message transmission malfunction one tow and  days later i got it back with the rear differential replacedone day after i got it back from the local bmw dealer new warning  by  chassis stabilisation malfunction contact your bmw dealer  do not brake hardgiven that this fully loaded nearly  car is completely unreliabe i am seriouly thinking of getting rid of it
BMW,Engine/Performance,i with automatic transmission i just bought black with venetian beige i at beverly hills bmwi like the performance and handling on this car i use to have  series but with this  i dons miss it i got the sport pkg premium pkg convenient pkg and premium pkg
BMW,Service/Maintenance,hesitation problems driving me crazy i would think twice about purchasing this vehicle i have had a big problem with surging and hesitation at low speeds the dealer has insisted that it is normal with the adaptive transmission but i can assure you it is not normal google bmw f transmission problems and you will see the problem is widespread the sad thing is that i really love the rest of the car but after spending  i dont think i should be dealing with this it really takes the pleasure out of owning the car
BMW,Engine/Performance, bmw   my previous bmw ownership included a   and a bmw  convertible owning these cars have turned me into a bmw fanthen i bought this   with reasonable amount of expectation but it turned out to be a big disappointment i only have one complaint about the new bmw and it is a substantial onethe new  speed transmission has a almost turbo lag kinda delay followed by a surge of power when accelerating in low gearsprobably because it has a adaptive mode trying to learn your driving style that drive by wire feature alone kills the overall driving experience of a bimmer
BMW,Price/Value,look out open road bought it recently and car was well cared for what a carlike going on vacation every time behind the wheel just pure pleasure i know it will eventually cost me but who caresyou cant take it with you if you have the desiretry one used and you will see what i mean
BMW,Price/Value,"great car limted by electrical quirks mechanically the only thing ive had to do is replace the brakes once  electrically its been a nuisance  in the past  years its been in the shop for ignition failure windshield wiper motor replacement twice window regulator failure electronic trunk release failure failure of sunroof loss of sound to half the speakers the heated seats keep blowing a fuseand it cant be repaired without replacing both front seats  each shop visit has run in the several hundred dollar range and bmw dealers seem to think its nothing for you to wait  weeks for an appointment and then leave your car there for  days"
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmw  once i have owned a bmw  i can truly
BMW,Comfort/Interior,"top of the food chain i am coming up on  years of ownership and k on the clock  yes i just did the radiator but got the cat and a couple of small items under the extended warranty   i have owned and driven various bimmers and this one is the berries  do not i repeat do not drive this car for any length of time if you cannot buyit will ruin you for all other cars even some other bimmers"
BMW,Service/Maintenance,s are bad news i bought this car as a lease return
BMW,Engine/Performance,"stay away this is the most dangerous car ive ever owned in the two years i have owned it the engine has blown the electrical system has completely failed and the car almost caught on fire i bought it used with  miles on it and it now has  miles on it bmw should be embarrassed the only saving grace is that i have a  mile extended warranty it has easily saved me  in repairs i am about to trade it in for a honda accord"
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,lane keeping feature is dangerous the vehicle frequently strays out of lane even when lanes are clearly marked when the feature is used there is added strain and stress on the driver since there is no predicting when the car will leave the lane to oncoming traffic or obstacles the manual and videos say system can be used to over  mph and in traffic and will provide a more relaxed and rested experience do not purchase vehicle with this feature because it is too dangerous to use
BMW,Comfort/Interior,uncomfortable front seats too much technology just turned in a   series sedan and replaced with a  s series with similar options the bucket seats are very uncomfortable with poor lower back support i wish i noticed on the quick test drive after a  minute drive had an aching back is it me or do these cars have way too much technology in them maybe bmw was too busy tweaking the tech to realize the front seats are horrible  i will probably need to get something to modify the seat so it is bearable on road trips over an hour
BMW,Comfort/Interior,really disappointing experience this is my fourth bmw i had good experience with older bmws this cars auto startstop function is abrupt the entertainment system is highly unreliable after a few months use the usb port to ipod failed to function then the email to car system failed to receive messages sent to the car the bluetooth connectivity is problematic phone calls will be received but the sound does not go through the speaker system when you reported that to the dealership they claim bmw has problem with keeping up the software updates for iphones they cannot fix them the headlight controller unit failed but the dealership failed to fix it during warranty period  the seat belts buckle hits the hard plastic of the b beam and creates a rattling noise when driving it seems that bmw has a hard time get their software working properly in their entertainment system
BMW,Service/Maintenance,good luck if you have to tow or service it i drove over a rock and had to have the car towed to the bmw in port chester nyit took visits from  tow trucks to finally get one that would crawl underneath the car to put it in neutral when off the guy told me he would never do that if i had broken down on the highway bmw assist was cluelesscar needed a muffler which took  days for bmw service port chester to get it from germanythen they decided it needed another muffler part which was backordered  months in all it would be  months to fix a muffler they couldnt care less about the inconvenience to me
BMW,Design/Style,good but not great after telling myself not to do another bmw since i hate turbocharging i went and did it because of the lease dealalso the cars are getting to be soft while mercedes offers sport versions of their cars and regular tires no run flats why didnt i go mbthis is not a bad carit is just boring to look at and boring to drivethe m sport package helps but the sport suspension tuning is still soft
BMW,Price/Value,bugs still not worked out first the good things the i drives like the  series and is larger and heavier corners like a dream and is solid as a rock as much as i hate to say it bmw really overengineered this car in many respects so many unnecessary saftety features used my series had one thing go bad in  yearsthe oxygen sensor thats it my i has  miles on it and here is a list of things on the car that dont work cruise control rear window sunroof ebrake catalytic converter broke and o sensor went out yes it is true parts for bmws are expensive probably  times that of even other luxury cars i feel betrayed i hope this travesty is never allowed by bmw again
BMW,Engine/Performance,shame on bmw what an expensive piece of junk at  miles this garbage had nothing but problem after problem the catalytic converters went luckily covered under warranty the engine had multiple oil leaks at different times the power steering hoses leaked the front control arms had to be replaced on the inside the power tilt stopped working the drivers power seat stopped working the electronic dash lights burned out to the point of being of the messages being illegible and the back cup holders wouldnt open all of this happened while i pampered the car i am somewhat of a fanantic about caring for my cars i gave poor performance and fun to drive scores because i was afraid to drive it
BMW,Mileage/Fuel, is  bmw is not called the ultimate driving
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,"the ultimate driving machine i cant wait to get in my car and drive this is the ultimate driving machine"
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,i never had a problem
BMW,Engine/Performance,nobody does it better heatac control awkward difficult to operate while driving too long a reach around shifter otherwise cant beat it true pleasure to start it up and drive
BMW,Service/Maintenance,if you live in the northeast do not buy this car the low pro tires and  inch wheels can not survive the smallest pothole in the road or the slightest raised railroad crossing i have had  flats and  damaged rims in  milesmy children are afraid to go in the car dont even think of taking this car into a major city oem tires are  installed and dealers do not stock rims or tires for this model call and ask them every time you get a flat its a three day wait dealer says call bmw north america bmw north america says sorry we can not help you customer service is not even aware of the alpina b model this is my first and last bmw
BMW,Design/Style,bad styling all in all this car is very pleasing to live with only complaint is the styling which is to busy in my opinion styling mimicking the regular  series would be a big improvement
BMW,Design/Style,a beauty with room for improvement i agree with a lot of the last review  for me it was hard to get in and out of the car and i am   the door lock button is in the middle of the consul rather than on the doors so without the remote key one has to crawl in to get the other doors open somehow the front was couple of inches longer than the previous model and i was always scraping the bumper when i parked  the car was a bit too low and too long in the front after  years and k miles the car depreciated k or about  and already has an oil leak i liked the exterior styling of it but never liked it as much as my previous i from  which i drove until
BMW,Service/Maintenance,still the ultimate driving machine steering is a little too sensitive and the run flat tires are a bad idea  tires can be replaced  steering you just have to adjust to  otherwise this is a great car
BMW,Service/Maintenance,big question mark on bmw quality and services  years after purchase my transmission gone bad and the dealer replaced it the dealer replaced a couple of spark plugs in  years the dealer didnt tell me about the replacement of spark plugs soon after the factory warranty expired the intake valve was loose and the dealer needed to retighten it even well before the warranty expiration the problem jerking and shaking associated with the loose intake valve started another bmw no way buy american or korean
BMW,Comfort/Interior,too delicate treat it like an iphone i bought this car for my wife very disappointed on a hard raining day she drove through no more than  inches of water and below the door level the car stopped and the dealer called it a total loss so much for german engineering why cant they keep the electronics higher off the ground and seal the floors better for me it was too hard to get in and out of the car and i am  it is difficult to find the comfortable seat position but it may be different with the power seat the door lock button  is in the middle of the consul rather than on the doors so without the remote key one has to crawl in to get the other doors open after  years and only  miles the car depreciated k or about  i liked the exterior styling of it but that was about it
BMW,Engine/Performance,"beware engine malfunctions rampant just purchased a  i with the  cyl turbo after  miles engine malfunction comes up on the display after some research looks like this is a common issue with these newer f series usually a transmission failure or vanos failure  html removed"
BMW,Engine/Performance,built to drive
BMW,Engine/Performance,wow the mpg is no joke my wife and i purchased a  d sedan about  months ago and we could not be happier she had a  g gt and were used to driving a high performance car but it got horrible fuel mileage avg  mpg when i found the d and the mpg estimates i was very skeptical of the accuracy of that fuel rating but let me tell you right now for a fact this car gets every bit of mpg on the highway and i drive it with a heavy foot we took a  mile trip and i drove at  mph almost the whole way and i was blown away when i saw  mpg driving in comfort mode and i was not trying to conserve in any way we have not found anything that we do not like about this car so far
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,do not purchase a used bmw many things shoppers should know about a  series bmw before purchasing one all my adult like i have wanted a bmw so last year i purchased a used one  xi i have had many problems with this vehicle since i purchased it and it has costed me over  i have had two recalls on this bmw and the dealer told me that they do not know how to repair the recalls i was told that as soon as they find a solution they would let me know i have waiting for about six months and they have not call me yet gas mileage on this vehicle is very poor things that i had to have repaired is  oil pan gasketswindshield washer neck  filler replaced broken gas meter replaced transfer case motor replaced radiator sensor replacedand the replacement of the gas tank i have purchased over ten used vehicles in my life time this bmw is the worst car that i have ever owned i have told family and friends not to purchase a bmw its one of the worst cars on the market i plan to get rid of my bmw asap
BMW,Engine/Performance,going downhill fast when i first got in this bmw xi i was completely excited it felt good and was tight i finally was able to afford a car that was going to get me from point a to point b without continually having to work on it it only had k and being a bmw its gotta have another k right the first thing i noticed was that the breaks had a bad chatter but at that mileage it was expected so i had them and the rotors replaced  at k the awd quit work and that also makes the cruise control not work it ended up being a transfer module of some sort and was  to fix after that was fixed the check engine light came back on i took it back  for scan and they said that the catalytic converters needed replaced  i didnt replace them because they were just starting to go bad and they said theyd probably last another k i soon started to smell an awful oil smell and it was from the gasket leaking in the oil filter housing  right after that the cross under pipe for the coolant system got a crack in it  and i had to have it towed back to the mechanic  at k the car picked up an annoying surge and i knew that i had a misfire so when i took it in to have the airbag replaced from recall  i had them scan the motor and they said that cylinder  coil was bad  for coil  for scan now i have that oil smell back again and bmw says that i have a valve cover leak  needless to say its time for a new car it was fun while it lasted but its going downhill fast
BMW,Price/Value,worst car i ever owned i will never buy a bmw again if you go past the warranty sell it asap
BMW,Engine/Performance,plastic engine parts  really just spent a bundle fixing an oil leak caused by a plastic valve cover that cracked this is apparently common for these models after k mine had k and was regularly serviced at the dealer in my case oil leaked onto the ignition coils causing the engine to misfire unbelievable that the ultimate driving machine uses plastic on a part that is subject to such heat
BMW,Service/Maintenance,bmw gone down hill  sold thank god my rd bmw  and a m and previous xi sp got it from bmw dealership with k one owner  changed the oil every k baby the car thats just how i m car was great until it hit k first the electric water pump  and got me and my year old on the side of the freeway very dangerous on my opinion called bmw they tell me its a common thing ok a month later the low warning oil light comes on  head gasket cover leaking oil  call bmw reply again its a common thing  weeks later the tesion pully  shocks  bmw again its a common thing  seriuos if its a common thing shouldnt it be recalls ps also this parts should not be regular maintenance parts
BMW,Price/Value,crap i got my car used i have had it for a year in a half i have had  worth of work on it already this car is some nonpermissible content removed i will never buy a bmw again
BMW,Service/Maintenance,nightmare since i purchased this car as certified preowned it has been back to the dealer for repairs  of the time after multiple complaints to bmwusa the dealer finally contacted me before that the dealer ignored me i am still using a loaner car and the computer module must be replaced
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,worst car in my life just happy to turn in this rubbish as my lease has expired terrible ridding thanks to run flat tires transmission is jerking brakes are sticky real fuel consumption  mpg city  mpg hwy im just  tall but is is very uncomfortable to get in and out of the car leatherette seats very poor quality cant compare this car to my previous  model
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,my nd  i sedan traded my   with k miles about a year ago for k bought a m and hated it then bought a prius and loved the gas mileage but hated the build quality so i found a deal on an  i sportpremiumcomfort with k miles paid  the bumper has been repainted but the car feels solid more solid than my last  that was a demo when i bought it my new  has black leather and blue metallic paint the steptronicpaddle shifters shift smoother than my last i for some reason i love the tight feel when i steer around corners definitely a  door sports car although it can be tough to turn the wheel at low speeds without active steering
BMW,Service/Maintenance,lock and window shutdown my car had a complete lock and window shut down i was stuck inside the car for over  minutes the salesman told me the same thing happened to his car i want to know if there is anyone out there that has had this same problem also the driver mat rolls up and presses on the accelerator i had horrible customer service experience as bad as having to crawl in and out of my car not even the manual key would open the door
BMW,Service/Maintenance,last bmw  too much technology not fun i have been a huge bmwfanatic until now my  is too electronic and takes away from driver inputs regarding acceleration braking and lane changing in order to smooth the ride with the runflat tires the base suspension is too soft  the steering is still tight but swift lane changes are mushy rather than sturdy lots of body roll accelerator has a delay when being aggressive to swiftly pass which is more dangerous brakes also have computer delay which can be annoying sounding as per  bimmer magazine the free maintenance intervals are not enough to keep these cars on the road past k if you must then lease it i like my porsche cayman better with tight steering
BMW,Comfort/Interior,fun but horrible for rough roads so this is a screamer  everyone knows that   weve had a really bad experience however   weve bent  wheels and replaced  tires due to impact damage   the problem  well we live in new england and our roads stink   huge seams where the roads are being repaved are very common    i think maybe bmw didnt give the suspension enough travel or throw or whatever its called because the shocks dont absorb the shocks on bad bumps and tire and wheel damage are frequent and hugely annoying  if you do buy this car in the north east i would not be sure to buy from a dealer that offers wheel insurance  ours didnt  and for bmw the lousy thing is no way out  cant get smaller wheels
BMW,Service/Maintenance,k miles and total failure i like the car overall its my rd and so far no big problems until the  version at k miles car starts lurching and dies total electronic failure checked site to see if anyone else had the same incident i will post an update after my tow trip to the dealership
BMW,Price/Value,run flat tires ruined this car for me i leased this car in february  and have about  months left on a  month lease i have just put on my third set of run flat tires at  miles i wish i had checked the reviews of this problem before i purchased the car there are thousands of people who swear they will never buy or lease another bmw because of these miserable tires they are expensive and ride like a truck
BMW,Comfort/Interior,upgraded from an  camry fun to drive however interior and wiring stinks  driver side door cup has peeled twice  replaced nearly half of the exterior light bulbs on the car  i have the steptronic transmission and my car stalled twice at a stop  car has only k miles
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmw  solid fun at first i was a little skeptical about purchasing a bmw as many reviews including consumer reports stated that the electronics fail often and overall reliability is not as high as other japanese companies however when i read about the  twin turbo engine i had to take a test drive my first car was a  t audi with a chip and exhaust loved the audi but once i had k miles i sold it and got an acura i pledged never to get another nonawd car again the acura was plain boring once i drove the xi it was obvious that this was a special car i bought it the same day and traded in my acura tl
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,worst car ive owned very unreliable vehicle i have k miles on my car ive had the fuel pump replaced and the fuel injectors twice also had the water pump die on me on the freeway car goes into limp mode and was glad i wasnt killed do not buy one if its gonna be your daily driver and then whats the point of buying one anyway
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,lack of quality bought and sold my last bmw purchased a  i in may  and have been disappointed ever since the following problems ensued transmission failure large amounts of brake noise fuel pump failure and fuel injector failure all were fixed under warranty but who has the time to continually go back to the dealership run flats are a joke  very expensive dont last long and are hard to find  sold my car last week and purchased a lexus
BMW,Service/Maintenance,its in the details ill start w what i dont like the cup holders handling is pretty stiff which i enjoy since i get a sportier drive but drinks in cup holder go splashing around when i make a sharp turn second theres a blind spot on the drivers side and no matter how i angle my mirrors or slightly cock my head to check for cars there have been a few close calls my car now has a screeching noise driving at  mph the service dept says if they cant hear it they cant fix it i love driving the car but thankfully my lease is almost up because i would be wary about keeping it past its warranty
BMW,Engine/Performance,who asked for idrive and runflat tires i have had  cic for a year now the hardtop has been repaired once the engine malfunctioned and was in the service dept for  weeks for repair seat belt didnt retract and had to be replaced idrive freezes up periodically and bmw service dept cant fix it because they couldnt reproduce the same problem run flat tires are expensive short lasting and dont handle well compare with regular tires
BMW,Engine/Performance,not what i expected always wanted a bmw series with speed manual fell in love with the  coupe but way past that now  underwhelming acceleration and torque below  rpm tranny has been big disappointment maddening hvac and radio controls poorly shaped and sized storage cubbies cant see instrument lights with sunglasses under k miles had to replace driveshaft at k weird vibration in clutch pedal dealer diagnosed bad throwout bearing and replaced whole clutch the vibration got worse now they tell me itll breakin after k miles its hard to enjoy my drivers car when my clutch foot is tingling and im being tortured by diabolically illogical controls and wretched ergonomics
BMW,Comfort/Interior,only  mo old and it broke after having my car for only  months the seat belt arm broke it took  visits to the dealership until they finally fixed the problem when my car was  months old the windshield wiper fluid pump stops working it took  visits and they kept it in the shop for a total of  days until the realized there was a huge air bubble it was very annoying that these little repairs take so many visits and time to be repaired  every now and then my sos doesnt work which causes my bluetooth to malfunction other than that the car drives well and i still like the slick look
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,eats rear tires in record time between the wife and i we have owned an e e e and this e bmw  as with the others when it works correctly it is fantastic  when it doesnt it breaks your heart and wallet first off mpg is horrid  best weve had is mpg  coils go bad randomly ive replaced  in a year and a half  its a lengthy explanation but due to the direct injection you have to get the intake valves cleaned about every k miles and its about  each time  but the worst is the fact that it eats rear tires like nothing ive ever seen  like they are made of butter   miles max and it doesnt matter what brand or treadwear rating they are  summer tires allseasons doesnt matter nothing lasts more than about  miles ive owned this car  months and i just vaporized the fourth set of rear tires  it sees  highway miles  unless you drive sparingly or simply have unlimited funds to feed this thing i cannot under any circumstances recommend this car to anyoneupdate the rear upper control arm bushings were jello allowing dynamic camber and toe changes while driving  replaced with some adjustable heimjoint units and rear tires now last about  miles which is still terrible but far better than the  i was getting
BMW,Engine/Performance,ouch ride i had the car less than a month when i hit a pot hole on the long beach freeway popping one tire and bending two rims  the ride is horrible when going over small bumps and it bottoms out on small speed bumps  i had to replace both rear tires at  miles as they were completely worn through on the inside  the dealer helped with this due to the earlier problem but the tires should last much longer  there is no window switch in the back seat the rear seat passengers have to ask the driver to lower or raise the window   the car is beautiful but im glad im leasing it because its going back at the end of the lease
BMW,Engine/Performance,fun car but below average i bought the car in   the hardtop has been fixed once  the seatbelt metal clip put a few dents and scratches on the inside of drivers door  driver seat is uncomfortable despite adjustment  run flat tires are heavy and dont perform so well  no room for spare tire  idrive freezes up occasionally and service dept cant duplicate it and therefore they cant fix it engine malfunction reduced power came on at  miles in  months now pending repair
BMW,Engine/Performance,i convertible  i own a bmw  convertible  in  months it been sent to dealer  times first problem was brake warning second times it has same problemthird timeboth rear power windows brokenhave to order partsand then shift warning problemparts ordered is in back orderthis car is just a piece of junksit is a waste of money and timenot only thatit is frustrated tooi feel nervous every time hearing alarm warning soundmy car still sitting at dealer now waiting for partsi will get rid of this bmw car as soon as possible and never bmw again
BMW,Design/Style,the ultimate driving myth i purchased mine as a cpo with k original miles on itimho all the dealer did to cpo the car was to detail itwithin the first  months it had the following major problems power door locks failed  right rear wheel bearing went was bad on deliverycpo people were obviously deaf electric water pump failed low oil level warning light came on less than  miles after purchase further proof cpoing ignored that radio display not visible while wearing polarized lensesoil leak battery died bluetooth not blackberry compatible outside mirror motor failedbrakes stick on release
BMW,Engine/Performance,not good i bought this vehicle in  by two years i had double paid for this vehicle the instrument cluster panel even went out i heard from three mechanics that they have never seen this happen to any vehicle and that cost was almost k at to this very day i have replaced the instrument cluster panel the valve cover gasket the coolant expansion tank the radiator the control arms wbushings the radiator fan clutch oil pan oil pan plug split leather seats rear abs speed sensor broken center console headliner  interior fabric issues and anything else that was plastic long story short i have paid two times plus the purchase price value for this vehicle in  years wow she is now at  miles which i appreciate however i had over  on a nissan altima and spent less than a k in repairs they say the bmws will run forever yes i suppose they will so will i if you replace all of my parts since owning this vehicle i have appreciated the turning radius the vehicular power eg her get up and go but my overall disappointment as you deal with this vehicle ouch and never again unless i am so wealthy and can just burn money i will never own another
BMW,Engine/Performance,not recommended too crapy user interface not a luxury car at all had this car since  engine for this car is pretty good but has a lot of little problems came up from time to timethe alignment is one of the biggest i took it to the bmw dealer for three times and they still couldnt completely fix the problem the computer told them it is aligned but when i on road it always tends to go left the interior wood got a lot the cracks i guess from the hot and cold weather this car has very bad control interface the cruise control responds is very slow when i press the accelerator it didnt accelerate until least least  seconds later same goes for decelerate bwm should known better than in a highway  second disaster
BMW,Engine/Performance,dont buy this car overall this is the worst vehicle ever i keep fixing parts all the time if i can summarize all the problems with bmw i i will need more space please stay away from bmw you will thank me later great engine but thats it the quality of the cockpit is horrible the engineers who design the cheap parts in the interior and exterior should be ashamed
BMW,Design/Style, bmw i had the car about a year and my wife hit a deer with it the deer struck her on the driver side window and its horn left a mark all the way up the window that i cant even buff out however i feel that any other window would have busted and my wife would have had a deer in her lap
BMW,Design/Style,unreal control in snow and ice i have owned my  xi for three years now and have enjoyed driving it every minute i grew up with mercedes and am used to german engineering build quality etc however i think the  series particularly the xi awd variants are very tough to beat this was confirmed over the weekend when i drove from dc to north carolina and spent three days driving around in snow and ice in nc i cannot explain how well the car handles in bad weather it is truly unreal when trying to slip and slide the car takes over cuts the gas shifts the traction around to the various wheels and keeps the car in control no complaints in k miles of driving it
BMW,Engine/Performance,"whatever happened to quality  i purchased a new i and when the car had miles the problems began the instrument cluster blacked out for about secs while i was driving on the freeway at night and that reset everything but the total miles driven quite a frightening experience not knowing what was going on with the new car while driving mph soon the service engine indicator came on and when the car came to a complete stop it was shaking violently i brought the car back to the dealer and the mechanic made it out to be a tiny little problem peanuts he said so they supposedly fixed the problem but after a month the service engine light is on again at miles"
BMW,Comfort/Interior,it delivers on your expectations the car envelopes you inside of it and becomes an extension of your being it responds to a drivers inputs like its receiving neurological signals from your brains synapses where other cars will go skidding off the road a bmw ci with sport package just digs in and asks is that all you got
BMW,Design/Style,love the car hate the problems ive wanted a bmw coupe for years and was excited to finally get one  i truly love the styling of the car and the way it drives  in less than  years of ownership ive had to bring in the car in for unscheduled maintenancerepairs  times  these issues included replacing the door locking mechanism so i could get out of the car problem has resurfaced new transmission dead battery emissions issues coolant system leak and ac recall  if the problems with the car had been relatively minor as can be expected in some german cars i could understand but i dont think ill ever purchase another bmw again
BMW,Service/Maintenance,bmw buyer beware i purchased my  ci coupe in
BMW,Engine/Performance,"what a blast my dream car has been the bmwi have had this ci with premium sport cold weather packages for just under a year  i have over  miles on it and thoroughly enjoy it  i have had some minor problems with the driver door handle but other than that its been the dream i thought it would be  definitely a head turner  still cant believe its mine"
BMW,Engine/Performance,"do not buy ci i bought my ci on the st of jan  it has only  miles on it and the car has been to service  five times the passenger door failed first then the mirrors with interior light the engine has serious problems too especially in the mornings i can feel the wobbling coming from the engine i have checked the positive feedbacks but they dont seem right one of the review says  has  mpg thats impossible my bmws vin is wbabdpl and i am serious do not buy this car because even the service guys dont have an explanation for the problem my car cost me k ci with all the options i can send you pics"
BMW,Engine/Performance,"very disappointed in this car this car has had too many problems and bmw service have not done a good job at addressing them  i am tired of hearing that they cannot duplicate the problem at about k miles the rear differential had to be replaced with a rebuilt one car stalls at idle  one dealer replaced the ignition coil as a fix but problem occurred within  minutes after the fix another dealers claimed that there was no problem but finally admitted that it was an engine software problem for which a fix does not yet exisit shifting into st gear is hard at times speakers rattle there is excess wind noise at hwy speeds window regulator had to be replaced a disappointment"
BMW,Engine/Performance,"stalling out problem  other problems ever since i purchased my  ci  speed manual i was the service shop almost every week during the first  months of ownership i had speaker rattle noises coming from the passenger door insulation between the speaker and door panel fixed it equiped with bmw  rims that constantly pulled to the right bmw ended up replacing  tire and tweeked alignment to improve it worst problem encountered was the sporadic stalling problem when car was at an idle at a stop light engine would just cut out bmw claims it is a software problem and no current fix at this time and had to temporarily increase my idle speed by  i got rid of this car"
BMW,Comfort/Interior,the ultimate disappointment the ultimate driving machine was a big
BMW,Engine/Performance,"steptronic recall is a must new ci steptronic loaded  less than  miles car hesitates on acceleration  the car revs wildly then slowly lurches forward  dealer and bmw of na played dumb i produced documentation found on message boards  a safety bulletin sib   bmw tells dealers to replace the transmission on a customer complaint basis only not how makers of the ultimate driving machine should treat customers  nhtsa defect investigation underway as of feb   i have lost all confidence in my dealer and bmw for not contacting me"
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,bmw ci ive been driving a i for the past
BMW,Service/Maintenance,learn from our mistakes the  bmw ci is an awful
BMW,Comfort/Interior,my dream i have wanted this bmw for several
BMW,Price/Value,bmw this vehicle surpasses all other
BMW,Comfort/Interior,funtastic drive i drove a  series wagon for five years
BMW,Engine/Performance,the high price of luxury for a german car that costs so much on initial purchase it does not hold it value very long if you like speed and tight performance this could be the car for you you feel every bump crack and crannies in the road the run flat tires with stiff sidewalls adds to the performance level and harsh ride the  liter turbo has plenty of get up and go upon request the gas mileage was pretty good even while driving at  mph freeway speeds you can hear the husky sound of the motor was not impressed with the purchase experience and readiness of the vehicle at pickup time this soured my impression of bmw overall the service department was unable to find a noise in the dashboard that was heard after a hard braking then accelerating  i usually dont buy the same brand twice
BMW,Service/Maintenance, year old bmw xi i bought this car almost  years ago with k miles on itbecause of where i worked for  years car now has little over kwith proper maintenance changing oil when light comes on after turning off key i have had virtually no problems with this carit runs like the day it came off the showroom floor you guys saying poor reliability or have tons of repair work on it  did a poor job of inspecting the car before you bought itthe place where i bought the car from took care of every little thing and i had it worked on at his expense at two different places one of which was bmwi absolutely love my car
BMW,Price/Value,worst car i have ever owned it all began in  where we got are bmw we wanted it for a very cheap price because we already bought a  dollar volvo xc we got manual standard package non leather bmw in fall  the brakes squeaked and we brought it to a dealer that works on bmws we had to go to  of them and finally they worked  we are very mad at it and we  hope to sell it in aug

BMW,Engine/Performance,lovehate relationship this is my st bmw i dont know if ill buy another  this car is very fun to drive  however i am a big guy and it is a very small uncomfortable car  the redesign in  is a better compromise of room and performance  i spend a lot of time in a car so this matters k milesyr but it is fun on days off and short trips when i dont spend hours in the car  the worst feature is reliability  i bought it less than yrs ago  k miles i have k now  ive replaced all the window regulators and im about to again an electrical harness a throttle body boot and misc other items  the boot wasnt even under my cpo warranty  in less than yrs this car has had days in the shop
BMW,Engine/Performance,croys bmw i nothing better on the road for performance  i know its piddly but i hate the seatbelt  not very user friendly
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,"not making the cut i have had several problems with my bmw fuel filter and pump went bad ignition coils burning out window regulators failing moonroof not sliding properly i could name a few other minor problems but why  im currently in the market for a new car maybe a g or c definitely not another bmw"

BMW,Price/Value,"get a lawyer anyone got a good lemonlaw lawyer cause this company sucks the car handles well as it should for all that damn money you spent on it but as far as reliability is concerned it is horrible back and forth to the shop oh and no loaners the car keeps staling on me almost killing me and i spoke to all the managers and finally they tell me not to get a lawyer hahaha just did and now theyre freaking cause now they have too spend money for my lawsuit wanted to upgrade at first but now will never buylease one again"
BMW,Engine/Performance,problem since day  i will just list the problems  service engine soon light came on while driving home the day i purchased this car with only  miles on it  starter replaced  sunroof malfunction  transmission thumping when coming to a stop  dealer reprogrammed computer  driver door handle broken  remote on key stopped working couldnt unlock door  interior moulding around doors falling down on driver and passenger side  engineignition coil caused engine light to come on  recalled item  currently in shop for multiple other mechanical problems the most frustrating part is that most of these problems each required several trips to the dealer to be fixed correctly very disappointed

BMW,Engine/Performance,"my th  bimmer this is my th bimmer and over all all of them are very good not excellentleather seats its poor quality they break and crack in less than  years oldand carpets they are not very good either engine is very reliable"
BMW,Comfort/Interior,"interior design i love my bmw except for the completely uncomfortable front passenger seat and nearly unusable console  additionally the seat belts are difficult to use and are positioned so that the belt sits across your neck and continues to tighten as you moveexcept for the cup holders i find no way to use the console compartments the interior design will have to be significantly improved before i purchase anothe bmw  series coupe"
BMW,Price/Value," ci enjoyed the car but hit a big pothole at  miles and car was never the same shaky front end and rattles emerged backseat is totally useless and very difficult to get into or out of lacked room for storage of items such as cds sunglasses etc bascially too expensive for what you get didnt feel i got value for my money and wouldnt buy another bmw"

BMW,Price/Value,our bmw we got this car because it looked
BMW,Engine/Performance,drives like a dream reasonably priced vehicle that drives like a dream  however the cars blind spots create a lack of visibility that can be scary when i forget to take extra care to turn and look not just rely on my mirrors  many of the electronics are unnecessarily duplicated which i found annoying  having problems with engine light parking lights and door locks all because of electrical issues  still when you step on the gas or the brakes take a curve or pass another car you can trust that you will get where youre going with ease
BMW,Engine/Performance,base suspension is awful i just returned my  i with around  miles at the end of a  year lease although the  liter twin scroll turbo engine has plenty of power and the  spd automatic transmission was great the base suspension was so soft and unsettled that just driving the car made me nauseated this was my th bmw and suspension wise the worst early on in the lease period i changed to sport springs which made a big improvement in handling near the end of the lease i changed back to the oem springs and couldnt wait to return the car
BMW,Price/Value,ms little brother this car was a pleasure to drive but what really disappointed me was the trade in value now this car was in perfect condition with  miles on it with a sticker price close to  the dealer on trade offered me less than  i will never buy a bmw again
BMW,Price/Value,dont invest in this vehicle i purchase this car feb   it was  bmw i   i saved k in the purchase of the k vehicle   i put k down  unfortunately i was involved in accident which total the car   this vehicle within  year has depreciated  k   bad investment
BMW,Engine/Performance,awesome car if you buy the base model i bought a loaded i msport love the car id only buy it with all the great tech options  if you want the brand engine transmission and base features buy it  if you want one with the bells and whistles be prepared to own it for life because the resale is terrible you dont get any value for the packages  only navigation especially with sub models leasepurchase specials and cpos all in all i love driving my car but i hate that im upside down in it for its life id like to upgrade in the future but due to its cost from all the options ill be stuck for at least  years  this isnt a problem for normal people but my automotive shelf life is  year to  months so im saltyupdate traded the car in and got destroyed on the value actually tried to trade it in at the bmw dealership i bought it from their trade in offer was the lowest of all dealerships i visited  paid a ton of negative equity to dump the car  my wife wanted the  grand coupe so we leased one from the lessons learned from the  series
BMW,Engine/Performance,bad experience buing this car the coolant systen of this car is the worse than i ever see much of the parts are made of plastic is a shame that bmw dont make it much better cause is very expensive since i buy this car about a year ago  miles nd owner i have to replace the complete coolant system about wich cost me about  i feel in love with the shape of this car but i wont recoment it to any one also the engine is not stronge as is suppose to be if the engine over heat once you loose it
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,e  the good and the bad my wife bought a used  i in mid  with k miles there were a few minor things the car needed and i am a former mechanic so i had checked the car over well enough to know it wasnt in terrible shape the issues were minimal at first but then the list started and hasnt stopped we have put k miles on this  year old car and have done the following various plastic clipsparts all over the car windshield washer pump coolant hoses and expansion tank oil filter housing gasket front control arm bushings belt tensioners and idlers ac evaporator core transmission service two window regulators fuel pump  filter etc i could go on but im out of space plan on spending a lot
BMW,Price/Value,horrible i have owned my  i automatic for a little over a year putting k miles on it im  i have had so many problems i purchased the car for k with k miles on it i have put over  in repairs every month it seemed to be a new problem i still have yet to fix a leak in my power steering rack that will cost about  worst first car too much to take care of sadly the carfax is clean on it too which makes it really strange take my advice and do not but this car i feel i just got a problematic car shunned upon bmw now i love how it runs just too many repairs getting rid of it hopefully soon
BMW,Comfort/Interior,smell funny but its not i have  i i got it for my birthday this past year of june  so anyways when we got it like  months after we got it the air went out well the guy at the dealership something happened and someone else bought it out or something idk but when that happened we lost our warrently well we thought heck its a bmw what could possibly go wrong well like  months later air went out got it fixed  today got home and it started smelling on the inside looked smoke under the hood oh no wrong open the hood no smoke the rain was falling behind the motor and sizzling but the smell was only coming from inside the raining hitting the hood made made it steamy please help
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,not again i traded in my  honda accord coupe for a bmw  i i am so disappointed my car keeps shutting off while driving i am amazed no one has slammed in to the back of me everyone tells me that the car wont start cause it sounds like its starving for fuel although there is plenty i have had the fuel filters changed last year again yesterday my car shut off while driving and had to be towed to my mechanic i am becoming very concerned because i could be driving on the highway and all of a sudden it shuts off
BMW,Engine/Performance,blast to drive but tons of problems this car is a blast to drive but i have had numerous problems k headliner began sagging k both front door window cables had to be replaced k rear doors began leaking rainwater vapor barrier k hood mounted logo fell off k oil sending unit replaced k o sensor replaced
BMW,Price/Value,im hooked ever since i was  years old  i have found a least one aspect about any high priced purhased item that was disappointing  i am almost  and this bmw has not disappointed me in the least it is so much fun to drive it is almost hard to describe  you can feel the obessive drive for quality embued into this vehicle by the german engineers
BMW,Comfort/Interior,perception is the name of the game we have owned it since new it was maintained by the dealer of course until  which came quickly the only two complaints that i have is that the skip plate is too fragileif it touches the curb it will come off and sometimes you drive over the parts before you know it is failing  each time so you learn not to park near the curba few times preminum gas was not available had to use    the back seat is hard to get any use out ofthe seat belt sets too far behind you when you first egage itpeople service personnel are always surprised that it takes  guarts of oil
BMW,Design/Style,fun  this car has been a blast to drive it is truly a handling car it is a bit underpowered at times but the precision steering through the turns makes up for it the reliability is a bit questionable ive never had a serious problem with it but little nagging things at times all covered under warranty but still annoying would definitely buy another one they are that much fun and they look classy even in an older body style
BMW,Engine/Performance,great drive and looks but poor quality while i love the performance and looks i will never buy another bmw  the quality is poor from interior lining peeling excessive tire wear rough ride and poor electronics  i wanted to look at   sedan but decided on a lexus  not as sporty but quality is there  why else does bmw offer  months maintenance free except to cover their poor quality
BMW,Engine/Performance,"buyer beware my experience with this car has been both thrilling and disappointing   my complaint is that the front end is too low and scrapes against the speed bumps in my parking garage  i had a chrysler sebring some years ago that was lower and although there were scratches on the underbelly it didnt do any  further damage  unfortunately the plastic  in this car is inferior and has ripped loose three times within the last four monthes  first the front bumper had to be replaced when the plastic  brackets snapped off at a cost of over  to me  the second time the temperature sensor came loose and scraped the street until the wires  were stripped bare  its now happened again"
BMW,Comfort/Interior,unbeatable package you will not find a similar package of handling power space luxury and economy yes its not a drag racer not a  tv hauler not a cadillac not an ultra luxurious butt massage machine and not a mpg machine  but its an extremely well executed compromise of all of the above that no other car ive driven or owned car copy read reviews of all competitors and you will find that they all compare with bmw series  its not a coincidence
BMW,Design/Style,pdx silver bmw wagon one of the few wagons we tested that you did not feel your driving experience was being taken away as punishment for buying a wagon
BMW,Price/Value,i should know better dont maintenance and repairs are very very expensive compared to domestics brakes wear out too fast and its not that much fun to drive not a great road machine
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmw  xi  got rid of it at k miles if you are under warranty or less than k miles you are lucky otherwise get rid of it before parts start to fall of the car and it stops on you in the middle of a freeway at  miles per hour speed not once but thrice each time for a different issuei would also quote here a dealership words on a expensive repair cost sir what do you expect your bmw has over k miles i learnt my lesson that day
BMW,Service/Maintenance,failed tensmission   miles i trusted bmw to stand for quality who needs  year  mile powertrain warranty those are for compromised american brands or new korean ones without a track record o boyi was wrong to learn that bmw does not give a crap about quality and customerswith a car just out of the  mile warranty failing the transmission is normal thing you are on your own
BMW,Engine/Performance,what exactly is german engineering bought this car in november  with k miles as a cpo water pumps are electric and go out every k miles or so covered under cpo injectors on this car are notorious for failing had  fail on my car also covered under cpo finally the condensor was leaking also replaced under warranty i sold the car recently for a good price as it still had one year left on the maintenance and warranty but the new owner reported serpentine belt failure this is due to a bad subfram design and driver side engine mount which allows the belt to hit the subframe over time the belt will shear and will fail bmw has a new subframe but will not cover costs to fix their mistake idiots
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,run flats ruin the ride ive been buying bmws since  and this is one of the best models that bmw has ever built but bmw ruined it with those horrid runflat tires the smallest of bumps make the carshake because the run flats are so hard ive bent the front rims  times in  years so bad that the steering wheel shimmied like crazy when bmw starts building cars with the sport package without the runflat tires the i will buy bmw again the fuel pump went out at k and bmw replaced it no problems the runflat tires ruin the ride so i have put bmw onhold
BMW,Engine/Performance,not impressed i have had four audi a sedans for the last six years i purchased a bmw hoping for the same or better performance  im not impressed  the transmission is sluggish jerking around corners when accelerating tech says its normal runflat tires and no spare and the tires are not good the value for the money isnt there and not sure what the buzz about bmw is  i cant wait to trade this one for another audi
BMW,Service/Maintenance,runflat tires as you can see above i like the car  that said i feel the dealers take advantage of the customer  this is a lease and i need their approved service  they charged by  for a wheel alignment which could have been sold with poor alignment whos to know  also i was charged  for a tire replacement simple nail  this is outrageous  according to the dealer  runflats cannot be repaired  again i was stuck with the dealer recommendation  runflats are a poor excuse for saving the weight of a spare and peace of mind to be able to go  miles at mph try that on an la freeway  one must use secondary roads if one does not want to get rear ended
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,trophy car gas mileage on long trips pgh to dc and back is  mpg average over  trips  one way  the other  all is well except for nav system and idrive and their integration and no spare   get a garmin instead of bmw nav system which is a navtec base  garmin says in  ft make a rt on route  south  if you use the australian lady enunciation  navtec says make the next right  garmin shows road names on perspective view navtec doesnt  idrive requires too many actions for usage and interupts other audio as it drones out its directions  also i plan to replace rfts with gfts when they wear out and lug a spare around in the trunk
BMW,Engine/Performance,fuel injection problems this car was in the shop every  months for the  years that i leased the car they cannot reliably repair the fuel injection defect  top speed of  mph when the fuel injection system goes down  very dangerous car on the highway with this chronic issue  bmw not compassionate with problems they will repair but no responsibility  they should publicly warn about their defect in this car  they should offer incentives to turn in the car  i turned the car in  months early for the safety issues and they expected me to pay a fine  will never buy bmw again
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmw  bought this car in dec  with  miles cpo  four times within  months it was sent to the dealer for engine lights turned on not very reliable fuel pump was replaced three times within  months
BMW,Price/Value,bmw  coupe got coupe  with auto prem and sport package car is great but hate run flat tires wake up bmw and get rid of those lousy expensive tires this car deserves better
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,broken at k on the side of the road i hate to say i paid k to be broken down on the side of the road at k miles  i am on my nd fuel pump as of last week tonight  on the side of the road no oil in the motor i could have driven but the i drive oil light blinked red and told me to stop driving the car is only good for wondering where and when i will be broken down next i had the car in the shop for electrical problems for two weeks its not maintenance free if you have to be on the side of the road as much as i have been if the reliability is bad then the build quality is just as bad rd bmw and last one i cant do this to myself anymore
BMW,Design/Style,dissapointed bought a xi sport coupe after previously owning  audi tts the worst feature is the run flat tires ride is very harsh and the  to replace is outrageous ruined one in the first  miles on an interstate pothole had to drive  miles   mph at least it lasted more than the advertised  mi the odometer and speedometer are  high thats worth about  on a  mile lease poor design v port in center storage area is in a position that wont allow the lid to close when any of my eqpt plugs are inserted gas mileage is poor lucky to get  mpg even on interstate tt with dsg got  mpg weighed about the same and was quicker  automatic is crude compared to audi
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,xi coupe got the car last october nothing but issues with it shifts hard constant jerking also experiencing issues with the oil sensor today my car has been in the shop for  days because of a bad fuel pump apparently waiting for bmw to send the part not happy with it
BMW,Comfort/Interior,love the car hate the tires i love this car except for  things  it is sluggish off the line unless you use sport mode on the tranny not that big a deal but annoying  i hate the run flat tires they are noisy stiff and leave too many uncertanties if you get a flat you drive on it and basically trash the tire and have to replace it i hate these and am looking to replace all of them and buy a spare problem is there is no place to put the spare except to eat up trunk space  bmw make these pieces of crap an option not std buy the car love it but negotiate for them to swap tires you will be glad you did
BMW,Service/Maintenance,mr nasty rules the road first bimmer but hooked for life this is the most amazing car i have ever ownedhonda nissan ford mb porsche mitsu hyundai jeep got it with sports pkg heated seats navigation is a must but a little difficult at first
BMW,Engine/Performance,great old second car bought my  i in september of  with around k miles on it i have the automatic base model which doesnt include power seats or fog lamps but has every other option such as leather and sunroof got it for around  with a yr unlimited mile warranty bought as a second car to keep the miles down on my  vw passat starter began to stick when weather turned really cold and was replaced at local bmw dealer under warranty  bill also had an issue with the left turn signal blinking continuously even when it wasnt engaged  parts and labor overall not bad for a car bought cheap and is yrs old drives like a dream a little thirsty on gas for a  cyl engine
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,good car if you can afford it my dad purchased this car for me in may i had it inspected and they said it was in above average condition since i bought it ive had to replace the expansion tank for  power steering pump and hoses  oil change for  and other hoses for  this is come to be expected of an  year old car the brakes and brake pads have been fixed but constantly squeak and my lighter and car door lock button are broken ive had the car inspected and the tires aligned but my car always pulls other than those issues the car is good to drive although it is terrible on gas i am quite fond of the car but if i have a repair over  again im selling it
BMW,Price/Value,i long story short  i wound up with this car by accident  i thought that i was buying something nice and boring and maintenance free  itt aint  these i bought one for my daughter things take some tlc but if you stay away from the dealers and do your own work theyre no more expensive than a pontiacgot the bills from my wifes dealer  e  watch out for the cooling system  radiators and water pumps are plastic and die after  years keep up the routine maintenance religiously  find a reasonably priced source of parts
BMW,Engine/Performance, a dream bought this vehicle for myself with  miles and fully loaded with no apparent deficits one owner vehicle body engine paint interior exterior in immaculate condition have driven it on long and short trips and it continues to elicit stares from lexus and benz owners this vehicle is made for driving

BMW,Engine/Performance,worst car ive ever owned i had a  lexus sc i regret selling most solid car ever i owned chevy honda toyota nissan lexus and now bmw  bmw i i bought with  miles and has  miles now  months everything that can go wrong with these cars has gone wrong sun roof stopped working roof leaked whenever it rained front lower bushings and ball joint went bad rears are bad now cant get it aligned at local shops bmw only service engine light on p running lean saw big tear in intake tube fixed but light still on burned   quarts of oil within  miles valve cover leaked wipers park  high passenger rear window rail broke on freeway stuck down cheapest luxury car
BMW,Price/Value,i should have taken advice the st time i recently purchased my  bmw xi this year from a private one owner family stay away from the dealership they are very expensive  for an oil change please at all cost if you can take the time to learn how to work on these cars with some basic tools a service manual and some patience you can do some of your own work once i brought my xi home everything that could go bad went bad the first problem i incurred was when inserting the key to unlock the door the lock cylinder fell out of the door all my window regulators failed in all doors the side mirror cover fell off the gas mileage is horrible despite full tuneup i am unsure if i want to continue ownership
BMW,Price/Value,dont buy it when gas prices started to rise a few years ago i got out of my yukon denali and bought this bmw  it has had  window regulators   new battery  a new alternator  and now the transmission is shot   not to mention a few months ago the car started sparking around the battery which sits in the trunk and cost  worth of fire damage  this is the worse car i have ever owned not to mention the bills to fix these problems  i would not recommend this car to anyone
BMW,Service/Maintenance,byebye bmw the romance is over i wanted a bmw all my life and bought mine brand new in  everything was good until a year after warranty expired all at once worn front axle assemblies with leaking cv boots broken rear springs broken thermostat unit and an extremely annoying squeaking steering wheel car had k miles on it sent a letter to bmw north america asking why cs rep calls me and says these are just normal wear and tear items  what do you want us to do about it drove honda civic for  years on same ct roads  no problems at all on my way to trade this jalopy in before it falls apart on me again
BMW,Price/Value,fun to drive i have owned this car for  years now last year my transmission had to be replaced and this year both front axles needed to be replaced because the boot leaked car is definitely fun to drive but the problems it is starting to have are serious but strange since i only have  miles on the car havent had any accidents so not sure why all these problems started my advice if you buy the car consider getting one with an extended warranty  mine paid off big time
BMW,Comfort/Interior,disappointing xi i bought it new in  since then had to bring it back to the dealer for replacing  window operators alternator defect found after the nd year after  years  just magically right after warranty expired  rear window molding is peeled off found to be attached to the car body via stickon glue  is this really german engineering and whenever it rains water is found puddling up in all footwells the dealer tried to fix door seals  times but watermoisture still infiltrate hint for other bmw owners if your car windshield is fogging up after rainy weather  check under the floor mat one more problem power connector for the front seat operator is a cheap clipon  bmw value engineering is so disappointing
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmw series is a money pit while the performance of this vehicle is phenomenal bmws commitment to customer service and establishing brand loyalty is  vehicle reliability is terrible as it has left my wife stranded on several occassions this year alone ive spent  in repairs first the ac then  of the  power window motors went out at the same time not to mention the times the vehicle has left us stranded when i contacted the north america corporate offices i was simply advised to buy another bmwno customer goodwill credit for repairs no complimentary service nonono in conclusion not the brand of quality customer service andor commitment they portray to be
BMW,Comfort/Interior,just this once previously owned a subaru wrx but hated the narrow torque band xi is a much nicer car to drive but very small trunk and interior
BMW,Service/Maintenance,bmw has thw worst service you obtain better service from hyundi
BMW,Price/Value,"why do bmws fall apart so fast at first it was a passionate love affair every drive was special  but now only  miles later    im looking to get out of it combine the arrogance of their dealers with the abnoxious behavior of their nj hqs personnel and what do you have  a terrible product that even though it drives well isnt worth the grief that it puts you through things gone wrong  suspension bushing fell out  drinks coolant and no one knows where it goes  its on its rd set of cup holders  radio speakers giving up the ghost  ac always recirculates cant stop  steering wheel squeeks but only when away from the dealership  other probs"
BMW,Comfort/Interior,"wow now this is a car this is a car as it should be to say itis fun to drive is a big understatementit continues to amaze me for what it cando it fits like a glove and always doeswhat i ask it to and i ask a lot of itrain sleet snow no problems there abit rough on the body on daylong drivesthough due to the sport suspension hopsa little on rough curvey roadsbutalways ends up where you want it to allsaid i wouldnt ever buy anything else"

BMW,Comfort/Interior,"expensive and shoddy build quality both my sister and i own a  ci and  ci respectively  her car had a broken gas cover when delivered after about a year the overhead liner began to fall off the sunroof broke and the electric seat broke  when i took delivery of my car in early  the ac did not work and about six month later the doors could not be open from the inside  where is the german quality i have read and heard so much about"
BMW,Engine/Performance,"sweet ride my car is optioned with sp xn m pdc ette  spd  ive had the car for  months and  miles now  it has plenty of practical power possesses excellent handling characteristics and powerful brakes  i took it on a  mile road trip shortly after taking delivery and the car was a delight to drive  no mechanical or cosmetic problems to report other than the usual sticky gas pedal in hot weather  this is a warranty item that ill have fixed at some point  the hk stereo is fine but then i dont overboost the bass the opposite in fact  the worst thing about the car is it is unhappy going less than  miles per hour"
BMW,Price/Value,"ci  not a good choice i have had nothing but problems with this car the ac didnt work from the factory and there are numerous other things too much to mention avoid this car unless you have money to throw away"
BMW,Engine/Performance,nothing like a bmw a terrific driving car with
BMW,Mileage/Fuel, the ultimate driving machine  i just purchased my ci and it is
BMW,Engine/Performance, series  slow weak poor handling i made the mistake of buying a  series  should have bought the  instead
BMW,Service/Maintenance,"i hate this car there is always something wrong with this car the top quit working the trunk lid wont catch properly the allwindow switch broke the auto door locks stick the brake rotors are wear items the covering has worn off the center console the glove box wont open i will admit it drives great but i cannot accept the constant stream of annoyances bmw customer care couldnt care less ill never own another bmw"
BMW,Service/Maintenance,truly the ultimate driving machine i have had this car now for a year and
BMW,Price/Value,a definite head turner a little pricey compared to other
BMW,Comfort/Interior,bmw cic the bmw cic is nothing short of
BMW,Comfort/Interior,bmw i i just switched from an a to the i  i wish i would have made the move sooner  even the base series handles well is smooth quick enough and has a comfortable interior albeit small rear seat and trunk  ill be looking to move up to the  for my next car
BMW,Engine/Performance,medium the mannual shifting is not smooth
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmwi this is an excellant car
BMW,Engine/Performance,looks great but is always trying to break i bought this car in  on june and boy was i happy loved the looks and performance it was always polished and detailed once a month since the start of time  months after buying this from bmw dealer from a one owner the belts and pulleys went bad i took it to the shop and had it replaced with the oem parts note i only did oem replacements for everything your about to read my shop during the repair found out the front axel had gone bad as well as the engine mounts and transmission mounts reminder to those reading my shop is a very reliable shop in the bay area with  cars a day so after finding out bought the new axel with the mounts right away drove the vehicle for a month and everything was ok winter night decided to go get a starbucks coffee before i took off to go flying reminder i am a pilot as i walk back i notice severe smoke coming from the hood i popped the hood open the and expansion tank was cracked i had the car towed to the shop and had that changed right away as they where checking the saw the hose was bad as well as the water pump and the radiator looked as though it was ready to go ended up replacing all the parts right away thinking id keep the car still a month goes by after all that and i get a check engine light after driving from los angelas i diagnose the code since i use to work on cars at one point and it was the o sensors jeez lucky me it was the month i had to smog the car again back to the shop and had the o sensors replaced very expensive after driving back from the shop i notice smoke again from the hood look under valve cover gasket was bad turned around and left the car over night till they replaced that i drive the car for two months and again smoke from the hood i check and again valve cover leak i take it to the shop and it was not the cover but the valve cover its self that went bad  is the cost of that cover i said screw it ill deal with it yes the valve cover was torqued correctly when i had the gasket changed another month goes by and on the free way i get a check engine light and the car down shifted harshly to send gear from th found out the alternator went bad ridicoulas i was about ready to destroy this car note i did change the differential fluid and the transmission fluid right away when i bought the car due to this generation having transmission problems on the automatic version  months or so went by from all the bs and i decide to go to the snow with my new continental dws tires when i got on the freeway and got close to lake tahoe and to the snow the steering wheel got very very heavy power steering killed it self regardless since it was gone i was already in the snow drove it and ill say despite not having power steering this car handles amazing in the snow so when i got back i poured a temporary power steering fluid fix aprox a week went by when i put the fluid and i was rear ended by a jeep in traffic and i hit the car in front the impact was very hard the winch on the jeep hit me and i damaged the impala in front the front didnt have a scratch beside the license plate frame damaged on my car but the impala was damaged from behind the back bumper had a hole but over all it was a hard hit and it coped well two months later sold the car with bad power steering and shocks never again buying a new bmw now driving a  c amg mercedes ive always owned mercedes and never again will i buy a bmw my relative had a  i and that was bullet proof close to  parts original other relative  i with  miles it was also bullet proof both cars great other relative had a  i and had problems with tranny and electronics  i electrical problem  li electrical and engine problems overall bmw is not the ultimate driving machine and they are problematic i spent  in repairs in a little over two years it did mpg combined only freeway it did mpg worst decision ive ever made buying this car
BMW,Engine/Performance,do not buy this car yes i bought this car and all the drama that comes with itthis is the worst bmw i have ever owned and i have owned  others throughout the yearssadly i could not recommend any current bmw based on this one as unfair as that may bei bought this less than  year ago and  mos later started dumping in moneythe check engine light comes on about every  months i have had to replace all  oxygen sensors to the tune of  new trans cause the reverse went out inherent problem whether  or mi i found out all new tires for various reasons now needs an air flow sensor hopefully all
BMW,Price/Value,problems consistently the front plate of the bmw was damaged with the outside temperature sensor after  monthsbmw refused to replace on warrantythe generator failed the bolts on the underpart of the car were replaced at a cost of  within  years and no warranty note i had the extended warranty purchase for  yearsgenerator replaced after  yearsoil leaks valve gasket cover replaced by dealer yet the oil leaks are from the hoses and oil filter area which was not replacedtotal amount spent is k which i have not spent with an american car driven to m miles
BMW,Comfort/Interior,bmws are very overrated found a  bmw i with only k miles on it thought i had found a steal found out i was robbed had this car less than a year and have had to replace headlight assembly front grille trim rear window motor oil light comes on randomly worst of all when it rains the interior leaks so bad it would make a great fish bowl no one can find where its coming from biggest piece of junk ive ever owned now i know why it only had k miles on it no one wanted the piece of junk my first and last bmw
BMW,Price/Value, bmw xi was a little afraid of purchasing this car up front based on what i have heard from other people about bmws having bad electrical problems etc this car has been a very reliable car no major work other than front cv joints at k miles and front rocker arms at k miles other than that car has had very minor work things like thermostat rear brakes and front window motor car actually gets about  mpg not  which is what everywhere has it rated as vehicle is expensive to work on but rarely needs work not fast by any means but handles amazing mine is a manual transmission as well
BMW,Engine/Performance, i coolest car i have ever owned by a long shot  this car is a rocket but i can still get  mpg on the highway if i drive the speed limit
BMW,Service/Maintenance,performs but sensors and cold not good for the first  years i owned the car i only needed to change the oil and some minor maintenance but in feb of  it was a chilly  degrees fahrenheit and the crankcase vent froze up and it hasnt been the same sense  in fact it happened again in jan   i was able to have it brought to bmw who graciously covered  of the  repair bill  since then i have had an oil sensor replaced dipstick brake off and now my rear suspension coil needs to be replaced not sure how that could have broken  my next car will be a honda or nissan
BMW,Comfort/Interior,you must be ready to comprimise i have had my car for a little while now and it seems to be holding up i had a few issues  the moonroof headliner is defective and bmw tried to charge me  to fix it  just recall it please it is defective my drivers side window is sticking and i am afraid to get it fixed after reading the reviews here that say the window leaks after the repair i keep burning oil and i will have to see what is causing that brakes go fast and cost  to change and i had some loose exterior trim through seemingly no fault of my own loose interior grill on speaker loose mat anchor
BMW,Design/Style,such a disappointment since the intro of the e body style i drooled at each passing bmw  i finally had the oppt to purchase a red i and i couldnt have been more excited  boy what a let down  problem after problem after problem  i have replaced  rear tires  there is something wrong with the rim and they deflate and boom  the tire dealer says that he cant find anything wrong with it  i have replaced  turn signal bulbs and  headlamp bulb  recently i had to reseat the other headlamp because it just stopped working  i have had the window problem with the regulator but was able to fix myself it still cost me  in parts  and dont get me started with the ac  i could go on dont buy this car
BMW,Design/Style,rocky start this is my th bmw in  yrs and by far the worst   everyone claims this is a tight handling cari simply dont understand how anyone can say that  compared to bmws of the past this handles like an oldsmobile  its so loose that it is pathetic  the design of the car lends itself to very poor visibility  the blind spots are terrible  within the first  months of ownership the car broke down x with the same problem bad auxiliary fan  bmw was difficult to deal with during these problems  otherwise reliability is fine
BMW,Engine/Performance,pathetic quality the total of  window regulators have been replaced in just  miles in addition had to be repaired electric sunroof ac fan speed regulator windshild replaced due to bubbles in glass engine rpm sensor car began stalling mpg sensor also noticed a leak on a rainy day on the floor by the driver side front i am not a lawer but in my book ive got a lemon bmw must recall all the cars with substandard power window regulators and replace them with the re engineered ones since the replaced regulators are failing as well while i like the performance and the look of my car i am not buying another bmw any time soon  a car is more than just a smooth drivetrain
BMW,Price/Value,unsatisfied bought this car for reliability but it is anything but reliable there are lots of badly engineered parts that go bad and should be recalled but are not and you are charged for their replacement everything seems to cost over  to repair a regular oil change and inspection costs  the brakes and tires dont last long the water pump alternator and other parts die suddenly before k now at k the car has broken down and left me stranded on the side of the road three times this year the car does not deserve its reputation
BMW,Comfort/Interior,beware dreadful seats bought the car at  miles and have put another  on it in  months of driving  its been very reliable and only needed one sensor replaced post mile servicing seemed pricey quoted  but im coming from an old alfa romeo  very happy with the car overall except for things such as interior trim rattles constant and dreadful seats  my car came with the standard seats and they caused circulation problems and caused left foot problems no support on left foot and overall it was like sitting on a beach ball with support at center and little on sides i replaced them with the sports seats and they are much better but can be uncomfortable very very firm
BMW,Design/Style,dont do it  the car is nice looking and fun to drive but if you expect it to be quality you are dead wrong  my coolant tank bursed after k which caused my head gasket to break and now the care is basically worthless  if you want to drive this car for a few years and have fun fine  but i wouldnt hold it after k miles little things go on it all the time bmw is over rated
BMW,Design/Style,sleek i purchased the ci used w k
BMW,Engine/Performance,unexplainable feeling  bmw if you are picky about one or two repairs which can happen to any manufacture  this in not a car for you but if the performance the handling or the safety such as  ratio is what matters give it a try
BMW,Engine/Performance,its a beast with feminan figure if you know how to fix it buy it mechanics charge a lot
BMW,Engine/Performance,performance luxury well thought out picked up with european delivery program still frustrates me everyday that american drivers do not have the competence and courtesy of the germans on the road as with any car maintenance will be required due to volume production of the e parts are very reasonable and you can save  if you have some mechanical inclination everything on the car is easy to work with and finely engineered now with k miles since new the car still feels tight and solid even after front end collision caused by erroneous driver airbag deployed very little damage the larger ford excursion suv didnt fare as well i still trust the car to protect my familyno other make will suffice for me
BMW,Engine/Performance,buy a ford instead this is my first bmw  it has been a reliability and maintenance nightmare i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy  and it has been properly maintained  the car hasnt gone four weeks in a row without requiring major work  to date all four window regulator have had to be replaced all six ignition coils both cam sensors the mas both front control arm assemblies the transmission had to be replaced the o sensors and the list goes on and on and the damn engine light is still on  average cost for repair and maintenance per year   my ford f has k on it and it has only required one o sensor tires a battery and oil changes
BMW,Price/Value,ill never buy another bmw i purchased a  bmw i i thought i finally bought a great car it had  on it i now have  this car has been a piece of crap since the first month its so bad bmw will admit they break down all the time these cars are for the wealthy only the cooling systems are so poorly designed they have sensor after sensor but the cars still overheat definitely not reliable now im paying   more years on a car i cant drive bmw is fully aware of these problems and wont even tell you bmw resale value is poor i only recommend buying a bmw if you are very very wealthy
BMW,Engine/Performance,long term keepsake  it is expensive to maintain after the honeymoon warranty ie inspection   and  and tires oil change some dealers use the access by dealer only to sell unneeded part plus outrageous hourly fees i bought mine new but i would recommend to someone with a good income after  miles very reliable powerful and fast on the autobahn stateside a mustang in a barn
BMW,Design/Style,my first lemon this is my second bmw i have also owned several new japanese cars this has been in the shop about eight times for major repairs the brakes suspension and several electrical components have been replaced numerous times the dealer has been terrific about fixing the car  even when it went past warranty apparently the problems are typical of this series however the time and general hassle really diminished the bmw driving experienceand i will never buy one again hate the new styling anyway
BMW,Comfort/Interior,"expensive to maintain overall a decent car but once its over warranty its not worth having due to extremely high repair costs could use more power at timesone major complaint is the drivers seat has no support becomes very uncomfortable quickly and i only have miles on the car so the seats should have held out longer than that i would have thought the brakes are very high maitenance and dont have a very long life if i ever buy another bmw i would only buy or lease new"
BMW,Design/Style,bmws owners appreciate it i appreciate how bmw never lets me
BMW,Design/Style,i this car has an agressive exterior
BMW,Engine/Performance,ci this is an okay car but i would not buy another one i could write a book on the small problems i have had with this car over the las few yearsbut i can say the engine is one tough son of a gun
BMW,Comfort/Interior, ci bled my bank account i inheirited a  bmw  ci that was a low mileage car it had all the bells and whistles to boot initially i thought it was a fairly distictive car until all of the expensive problems crept up with only  on the odometer i had to replace so many things it was just ghastly sunroof problems ac ventilation electrical problems window motor failure suspension bushings oil leaks auto transmission problems and the interior began falling apart after living with this car for a couple of years i tired of its stiff ride road noise creaks and rattles stiff steering and spongy brake pedal also the hard seats were the worst i ever sat in game me back aches bmwway overrated
BMW,Comfort/Interior,expensive to own i bought my  coupe with very low mileage k from the dealer  it previously had one owner  i love the drive the comfort and the feel of a bmw  but beware  in one year ive been back to the dealer for a failed alternator rotors brakes tires ac failure moldings are loose etc  ive spent close to k in one year just on upkeep and ive heard it only gets worse  if you really want a bmw just lease it so everything is covered otherwise you will be incurring lots of debt if you doubt ask mechanics at different body shops and they will share their experiences
BMW,Engine/Performance,"very satisfied but overall the performance roadhandlingand drivability of this model bmw isoutstanding  also the interior designand  comfort is all you could ask forfrom this size vehicle  the onedisappointment is its poor road handlingon snowy roads  my car came with low profile allseason tires that trackvery poorly on snowy roads  snow tiresare a must in winter environments another negative impact of cold weatheron my  bmws engine is about a reduction in gas mileage"
BMW,Price/Value,value of certified preowned the certified preowned warrenty sold
BMW,Comfort/Interior,not exactly perfect this car had  mile on it when i picked it up xeon headlights have been completely replaced  times the autoadjusting driver and passenger window hieght is newer correct so your windows leak electrical system sucks my friends  series behaves the same way dont buy the car unless you get the sports suspension and  inch rims youll hate the ride with the  inch rims
BMW,Comfort/Interior,money pit i drove the ci for close to  years  the repair bills emptied my bank account  i replaced timing belt brakes rotors tune up air conditioner misfiring  twice radiator tie rod the list keeps growing  i finally had to draw the line when the trunk started flooding and i had to vacuum over a foot of water out from under the spare tire  i traded it for another car   the value was next to nothing and i spend my savings fixing this awful car  huge regret and now broke
BMW,Design/Style,beware of early transmission failure i was in love with this car  it corners like a dream and you can park it anywhere  unfortunately the steptronic transmission has a major design flaw some say it was an engineering compromise made to meet epa mileage requirements but i dont know this to be  fact  the reverse clutch drum has a c clip that holds the gears down under pressure  after k miles the clip breaks off and you suddenly lose reverse  it cant be repaired  you have to completely rebuild the transmission  it cost us  so if you must buy i would either get one w an already rebuilt transmission or invest in an extended warranty
BMW,Price/Value,time to trade while my series wagon was under warranty all was well  i didnt mind the repeated trips to the dealership to replace every motor in each of my power windows or my power steering leak or a regulator in my ac  however once the warranty expires the out of pocket cost to replace  a transmission along with lengthy list of repairs that accompanies each regular check up becomes quite irritating  the door panel inserts became dislodged and even the bmw logo on the hood came off   twice  too headache and expense for the ultimate driving machine
BMW,Price/Value,dont do it i brought this car in  and had nothing but problems st someone side swiped my red bmw that cost   after my car being in the shop for a week two days after i got it back it just stop working took it for service at bmw of catonsville and not only was the service crappy it will extremely over price my starter needed to be replace and battery which cost  a week later my car started over heating and when i called bmw back they said its not there problem so i warning you they look nice but my experience has been horrible as an owner
BMW,Comfort/Interior,worse bmw ive ever owned i have owned  bmw and was pretty pleased by all   including this one was bought new   this model is horrible  have to remove bumper to replace a headlight  awkward to reach power window controls unless you have  arms  electronics is a nightmare  leaks water rear foot and has never been in accident  paint flaked off roof rails  worse of all is the quality of the interior trim  it is made of white cheap plastic that is painted interior color  every time you scratch anything that is painted door panels steering wheel etc the cheap white plastic shows through  should have been molded in solid color plastic  also all  door handles have been sticking since  miles  horrible craftsmanship and design  cheap cheap chaeap  will never own another
BMW,Engine/Performance,read before you purchase pros performance drive experiencecons reliability cost to own either lease this car or make sure you can afford to be late to work to drop it off at the repair shop a few times a year read the common issues on the web from most bmw owners water pump shift display unit sport mode engine coils cylinder head known issue bushings differential tensioner pulleyand on and onissues so common i sent bmw corp the web links and they paid for the repairs car is not worth the trouble due diligence and experience has dissolved any brand affinity i have for bmwgood luck with the techs if the computer doesnt show them whats wrong they have to rely on trial and error
BMW,Comfort/Interior,worst car on earth disapointed by bmw i bought a i  second hand in  it had about  kilometers not miles since then i was disappointed the grey interior is now on a bad shape on of the cup holders doesnt work at all the button for the headlights felt apart and this is just the beginning i had to change the water pomp   the service department told that it happens sometimes   kms cover bolts that i have to change  camshaft and valanos solonoids total   plus many maintenance that i had to do i will never buy a bmw again the person who works at the sales department told me that once the warranty expires the real problems begin even people who are working at bmw dont trust the company
BMW,Service/Maintenance,bmw  been my worst i wish i had nothing but rave reviews on this car and that i have had an enjoyable experience owning the i but unfortunately i donti purchased the i as a cpo with the extended warrantymaintenance and road hazard for the tiresi am so glad i did because it was heavily usedthe service people know me by first name here in houston and that is not goodi go there on schedule with some sort of issue every other monthi have lost time from work and weekend days having to take it to the dealership for service and i have spent my patience with the bmw brand above and beyond what i should havei regret purchasing this car  now i have anxiety attacks driving it im done wit
BMW,Engine/Performance,too sporty for me this car is a nice car and very fun to drive its very fast with great mileage i get about mpg around town and  or  on the highway the engine is quiet along with the cabin but the exhaust is too numb for me compared to the infiniti the sport ride is way too stiff even without runflats the only reasons i wanted the sport package was for thebetter seats steering wheel and rims but the ride is just awful especially in the winter when the roads get bad its too small on the inside for three people and a little too small for two people its difficult to get into because its so low but the driving position is fantastic but the previous generation g was much better
BMW,Engine/Performance,worst car ever purchased car new i had nothing but problems engine needed all new lifters dealership fixed it but then the engine started making other noises care was in shop for  days dealer bought back car and had given a deal on a new  that one lasted about  miles before i traded it in it has front end issues and kept destroying the tires
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,fun to drive but this is a car that could have been great but was let down by lots of details my car was equipped with the sport package which is uncomfortable for around town driving and causes the wheels to pick up excessive road damage  the run flat tires tramlined dangerously at the slightest rut in the road this car had serious reliability and quality issues  my car was delivered with a coolant leak  also the steering wheel lock failed leaving me unable to start the car the passenger airbag failed in the rd year there was a rattle in the dash that wasnt fixed despite several trips to the dealer the drivers side door pull is made of painted plastic and was peeling when i returned the car
BMW,Comfort/Interior,a fan of german autos no more ive owned german cars my whole life but this will be my last the awd is similar to that of audis but too many electrical issues the runflat tires are awful the cupholders are inconvenient the leatherette interior leaves much to be desired and dealerships are few and far from my home in nh thanks to the runflat tires wearing unevenly and the pressure being off all the time ive had to take it in at least once a month the steering wheel lock sensor also went off causing the car to shut off completely and leave me stranded in the middle of nowhere at temperatures below zero and had to be towed i was without a car for  weeks while it was being repaired
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,poor reliability ive had my bmw since  though i love the way the car drives that love does not offset the dissatisfaction i get from living with this car  it cannot last more than a few months without some problem that needs to be resolved at the dealership ive had a bad fuel line grinding noise in the front suspension failed power locking mechanism x failed power window regulator broken front headlight washers x peeling paint from the interior handles x random steering wheel locking active cruise control faults and more ive never had a car with so many problems and im terribly disappointed in it my dealer is not the most helpful either which compounds my dissatisfaction
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,this whip is a stunner busted water hose
BMW,Engine/Performance,when is a bmw a ford when its fixed or repaired daily  the litany of problems with this luxury car dictates that you have to have access to a second car  factor that into the cost of ownership things that never went wrong over the course of owning several toyotas for hundreds of thousands of miles routinely crop up on this car  a true lemon and of course the cost of repair fully justifies the bmw break my wallet sobriquet  the headlight switch fell out of the dashboard  running lights cost almost  to replace  the worthless adaptive lighting broke and the estimate to repair and realign the headlights is thousand of   the windshield gasket is cracking and has to be replaced  ive had the engine gasket replaced twice each over   windshield wipers cost  at the dealer  theyre not available at auto repair stores  the engine oil and coolant fluid have to be topped off regularly  oh and the hood release doesnt work so the car has to be taken to a mechanic for those simple maintenance tasks  the gas tank closure broke  and dont even get started on the runflat tires  i order extras now because i know the winter pothole season will ruin one or two tires and last year a rim too  buy this car to look at and to show your neighbors that you can afford a luxury car but dont buy it for reliable transportation  unless youre married to an expert mechanic
BMW,Price/Value,not worth the money i purchased the vehicle about  months ago and sadly it has been disappointing for the most part first the ride was rough and the run flats tires were terrible i just traded them in for regular michelin tires and what a difference though still not a great ride as i expected yes there is no spare in the vehicle so rfts or not the peace of mind of taking a long road trip is out of the question the radio and other systems are difficult to understand and not user easy just today the the low oil light came onsystem never gave a signal that the oil was getting low prior until this dangerous point i had to buy the oil and sit by the roadside to put it in just not luxury at all audi
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,poor fuel injectors malfunction at   very poor comfort on flat run tires poor navigation on board system unpredictable fuel injectors is an ominous feature regret purchase vehicle replaced under new jersey lemon law is good for the public to be aware
BMW,Comfort/Interior,test drive carefully the whining noise transmission is totally out of character for a luxury car  dealer insists its normal  i dont believe itits driving me crazy  be sure to test drive before you buy and listen carefully for the whine
BMW,Engine/Performance,why did i wait so long to buy it i cant stop driving it i want to drive cross country with it there is nothing i can complain about the vehicle and trust me if it even had the smallest rattle it would drive me crazy  nothing but outstanding german build quality  considering i am comparing it to the hondaacura i owned before
BMW,Engine/Performance,lemon two problems have detracted from my enjoyment of the  bmw xi  car is back at the dealer for the third time for replacement of fuel injector jets  four this time  i get up to speed on the highway but do not have  a heavy foot and havent had the car on a race track  whats the story  getting close to lemon law time  the runflat lowprofile tires are just awful on new england roads  never never again  hit anything a halfinch high or low and it sounds like the car is bottoming out  extremely rough ride at even  mph
BMW,Price/Value,very expeneisve rft this car is so much fun to drive and so expensive to maintain it has been  months finally i hit a pot hole in new york city and had a bubble on the side our dealer changed the tire and charged  for one single tire i had insurance and expected to be reimbursed however this is another sign that this is a premium car and it is expensive to drive
BMW,Engine/Performance,one whiny bmw i overall car is fun to drive the performance is what you would expect from a bmw car the appointments in the car are first class but there is one thing that i see lately which has frustrated me and many other people on the bimmerfest forumsthat is a terrible whining noise coming from the transmission or differentialdrives people crazy   i seen the same issue now on  series and  series cars and bmw doesnt seem to care about this but it totally frustrates many people that have spent a lot of cash
BMW,Design/Style,bring my wallet  ie bmw the styling of this car sets it apart from all others in its class this is our second bmw and im a hard sell for import cars bmw gets greedy with there options they are priced to high and there is no such thing as a base model on the lot
BMW,Engine/Performance,theyre just not getting better aside from the reviews of people that went to a sedan after owning an suv or those who never owned a classy yet sporty vehicle same as suvs no offense meant but this iteration of the  series is missing the ultimate driving machine feel of old  the engine is wonderful however driving feel is almost numb and the drive by wire in addition to the awd makes for some very sloppy and awkward shifting also mentioned in edmunds review  the interior appears to be a throwback from buick and the exterior is very hyundai with the raised panels on the sides and large flat area around the wheel wells  im in a  yr lease but ill opt for a gx next time
BMW,Engine/Performance,looks great poor performance and ease of use this car looks like a classic design but with the worse user friendly design terrible perform gas mileage comfort repair cost and resale but that is to be expected given the poor dealer and manufacture and dealer support take the key fob design instead of simply replacing the batt you have to spend  on a completely new key fob poor design that bmw would not stand behind their cars have only gotten worse over the years and my  i was one of the better cars they made bmw has lost their edge and thats a shame
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,st time bmw owner we purchase our st bmw in december  we test drove audi a infiniti g lexus es  cadillac cts and chose the bmw my wife and i like all the features of the bmw  model wagon down to the handling the idrive is not that bad once you get use to it we currently have  miles and plan several trips this holiday
BMW,Comfort/Interior,expected higher quality issues to date rear tail light assembly failed front windshield rubber trim disintegrated rear window trim disintegrated rear view mirror retaining ring pops out making the mirror flop all over and not stay in position rear seat stitching failed near headrest seam these seem minor but they are all very irritating ive owned several mercedes a jaguar and my daily driver is a porsche this is my wifes car so i am constantly fielding these repairs first bmw and i expected more
BMW,Comfort/Interior,bmw this is my first bmw i have to admit i prefer the ride and comfort of my previous ford fusion the seats are quite firm the ride is more bumpy one thing that drives me insane is that the cup holders are in your passengers lap they really need to be in the console there is room in the current design for at least one in the console i wish they would have put a cup holder there instead of an open area
BMW,Price/Value,worst call ive ever owned i must be insane but i do not see how a call for over  could have such horribly uncomfortable power seats and probably the worst standard sound system i have ever heard in a car at this price the ride is awful i feel like a rabbit in a box being bounced around making a ride rough and quick bouncing does not make it solid bmw is grossly overrated for what you get it is all name and hype amazing what a manufacturer can do with a name they cheaped the  down so much but everyone obviously including me is willing to just grin and bear it wish i had not sold my audi a that was a quality car
BMW,Engine/Performance,malfunctions no help from bmw the satellite radio does not work never has the dealer says they cant fix it nor can bmw that its just a problem in these cars the usb port will not accept iphones it works with ipod but ipods are now integrated into iphones no fix for that either the speedometer is mph off so youre not sure what speed youre going i determined this from two different portable gpss no fix bmw removed the electrical outlet from the bottom of the dash board now theres only one outlet and its in the console but if you plug something in there gps for example the wire runs all along your console next to your gear shift lever plus the console lid will not close no fix for that
BMW,Design/Style,boy oh boy took a minute for me to get used to it but now i cant stop looking at it or wanting to drive it so fast so cool lots of bells n whistles with a true luxurious look n feel  im  so i feel a little cramped at times but a few adjustments here n there and off i go you will enjoy this car undoubtedly update  still drives like a dream and for you that worry above the car being unable to handle bad weather well we just dug ourselves out of a northeastern blizzard and this baby navigated the roads like a true champ  dtc off go ahead make the investment you wont be sorry
BMW,Engine/Performance,very disappointed in  months had to go to the dealer about  times the engine on light was malfunctioning then the tires wore out badly tires cost about  after a year thats a joke i had sebring convertibleput same mileage on it had no problems bmw is unreliable to me it is otherwise nice looking car fun to drive
BMW,Engine/Performance,long term ownership review    years i bought this car with  miles on it in august  it currently has  on it in january   the acceleration is really good cost of ownership is terrible still owe  on the principal loan and its starting to fall apart things that broke  ignition coils  separate occasions costing me about   coil per time diy repair  complete sets of tires currently the car has these problems  bad rear wheel bearings a failed disa valve engine rattle on acceleration  serpentine belt tensioner pulley is slightly squeaking rear upper control arm bushing is worn and oil pan gasket and valve cover gaskets are leaking the disa valve is a known issue and a problem solver repair kit exists on ebay for  a new disa valve costs about  and it will break down like the original ill be replacing the valve and wheel bearings as soon as the cold weather breaks i love the way the car looks and handles so ill be keeping it after its paid off
BMW,Price/Value,bought used  i x in nov  had to spend  for a sparkplug coil and tuneup when it failed a month after i bought it then  for an oil change because i could tell how dirty the oil was from the dash indicator there is no dipstick  and then it started to produce a oil burning smell prior to oil change inside the cabin when the car is sitting and idling had to replace valve cover gasketvcg valvetronic gasket and some other small gasket nearby i also replace the eccentric shaft sensor while they had the cover offthey recommended itso it made sense to when they had everything off that was another  i previously owned a   i and spend about k in repairs for the  years i owned it  i also had a  i for about yrs and spend about k in repair over those years  so i knew about spending more in maintainence when i bought it but its well worth it to have one of the utimate drving machines
BMW,Service/Maintenance,fun car poor reliability and even worse service i have owned two bmw  series cars in the last  years they are fun to drive and reasonably practical however they are riddled with stupid problems and my experience with their dealers for warranty service has been overall terrible every issue i have to bring the car in multiple times and usually i get it back with further problems caused by the repairs if you are expecting luxury car levels of service with you bmw you will be disappointed
BMW,Price/Value,bmw  big money waster i have had my  bmw i for about  years within the last  months i have dumped over k into repairs one leak after another after another my radiator went out at k miles valve cover assembly replaced oil pan gasket leak and more this car has been nothing but problems and everything shocker is not covered on my warranty after research online and reading forums a lot of others have had these issues beware once you hit k miles your bank account will hate you
BMW,Comfort/Interior,head bolt failure bmw knows about the problem with the two aluminum head bolts that fail but will not assist customers when failure is out of warranty  also quality of materials used in the interior is cheap  leather does not hold up and plastic trim on doors actually melts
BMW,Engine/Performance,bent rod needs a new engine ive been a member of the bmwcca for more than ten years now this is my th three series m package rear wheel drive manual speed power kit so  hpnoticed and felt engine noise since k miles thought it might be the flywheel and clutch replaced at  not the issuedealership did a compression test said it needs a new engine  bmw will cover  because its out of warranty i provided all oil change docs bmw wanted to see oil changes at least every k i averaged every  miles never auto crossed or tracked commuter car  year old father of four not laying down patches or beating on the carmy take dont buy a turbo model too much stress on the engine components never own one of these out of warranty youre asking for trouble fuel pump was replaced under warranty common issue water pump was on  my dime hardly reliable worst car ive ever owned beast on the highway at   yes sad to say it im a bimmer guy through and through but thats it for me bmw corporate said they wouldnt make a repair coverage decision until they knew for sure what the problem was i wanted the dealership to drop the oil pan to definitively diagnose the issue  so i could tell bmw na what was wrong after the compression test all of a sudden the dealership clammed up like it was a cover up the dealership would not go any further they told the manufacturer that it needed a new engine without ever dropping the oil pan and taking a peek didnt make sense i still want to have an independent garage take a look so maybe i can get some video or pics and post them forget about bmw customer service i got someone on the line outsourced from india if you must buy a bmw again never own one out of warranty unless your buying a fixer upper for a couple of grand i traded it in on a new silverado burying the negative equity of the bimmer into the truck payment tough pill to swollow good luck
BMW,Engine/Performance,nice car ruined by severe engine breaking  this is for sedan with auto transmission edmunds does not have a selection for auto transmission problem with the i steptronic auto transmission is the harsh engine breaking when you let up on the gas at slow speeds and especially in stop andgo traffic the heavy engine braking is enough to get many nauseous as the car does not easily coast to a stopi have never gotten car sick while driving but with this car if i drive it in heavy traffic for  minutes or so i will get car sick a bmw expert told me i have had a few customers tell me the same thing so i am not surprised of noticing the engine brakingfurther the car emits a very highpitch sound for about  seconds every time you open or close any door or the trunkfinally the run flat tires give a harsh ride
BMW,Engine/Performance,changes this car replaces a  i it has the same engine and basic design they have added  inch wheels about time and made the lights and body a little more sporty they have decreased the power hook ups they removed the ash tray and cigar lighter from the dash the only power hook up is now in the console bad idea this is the days of pcs pdas and portable gps they all need power the steering seems to be a little looser more play in the wheel etc than my  model not sure if this is just my imagination or not they decreased the number of speakers the sound is a little thinner
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,no more german cars as a car guy my whole life i always heard how great bmws were  so after years of japanese and american cars with no complaints i decided to buy a  series i could  finally afford  unfortunately i learned a bmw is no better and in may ways worse than a car that costs car less  it is a terrible value with poor fuel  economy higher than average insurance costs and unreliable parts that cost far more than a regular car to replace  i will never buy another german car after owning this car
BMW,Service/Maintenance,terrible car and poor service do not buy a bmw convertible because they leak water bmw engineers stated it is normal for all convertible tops to leak they dont disclose this information before you buy it bmw corporate office has terrible service dont expect a phone call returned to you

BMW,Price/Value,"be ware of your local bmw shop took my car to sf bmw for a k check up i was told that the cost would be they then took of new wiperblades and replaced them etc alot of hidden coststhey told me that the radiator was leaking and said that it with the plastic waterpump and thermostate housing at a cost of  i took the car to a independent shop who informed me that the production date of my car indicated that it would not have the plastic waterpumpif you need parts for your bmw try the partsbincom they sell oem and after market partssf bmw oem radiator          the partsbin ome with shiping  the radiators are both made by baher and are identical"

BMW,Comfort/Interior,"a hoot ive enjoyed this car for  years  sold a vintage jaguar too much trouble  this car is really fun to drive and still has absolutely nothing wrong with it yes we baby it a little  i look at it as a sports car thats practical the back seat is tight but comfortable and combined with the trunk there is lots of luggage space compared to a real  seater  while four seats may not sound like a sports car it doesnt matter since it looks like one and still to this day the car turns heads   mpg aint bad either"
BMW,Comfort/Interior,skip the i  you can do better the interior design is severely basic for the dollar value and poorly designed for userability there are no power lock buttons on this car and i didnt realize this until i drove it off the lot what car doesnt have power locks you have to pull the door handle twice to unlock then open the door car is very low to the ground so getting in and out is very uncomfortable car also lunges aggressively on acceleration have had the car for  months and still cant find the sweet spot on the accelerator so it goes smoothly probably because there is no sweet spot upholstery is unimpressive usb port is inside of center console which means charging something outside of your shallow narrow center console requires smashing the usb cable poor design bmw dealership refused to give me any written details of what my warrantee included and said all new vehicles are given the same warrantee standards  ok but what are the standards so now i am writing to the bbb awful experience in purchase and in driving this car overall for the dollar amount there are far superior vehicles to be had
BMW,Service/Maintenance,yikes that steering within twenty seconds of pulling out from the dealership i said whats wrong w this car  it is the steering  id read about the steering in the car magazines but i had no idea what it would feel like  its as though someone at the factory forgot some part when putting the steering assembly together  its just weird  maybe i might get used to it if i bought the car but i dont want to get used this this  ive never felt steering like this in any other car ive owneddriven
BMW,Price/Value,do not get th e i cannot plug in all the time and my  month old car has been in the shop  times  the hassle is not worth the price of the car
BMW,Comfort/Interior,suv i had a  lexus is sportcross for  troublefree years and despirately wanted to stay with a toyota product  unfortunately toyota has seen fit to make c pillars so big you can easily hide an escallade in the blind spot and thats just not okay  reluctantly i jumped ship and leased a  i wagon  true to the reviews it was very luxurious and handled well but it was a luxury car not so much a sport wagon  thanks to an idiot who couldnt see  pounds  feet away and decided to make her left turn anyway i recently found myself back in the market  with no viable options to even consider i leased a  i sport wagon  the specs say its the same size as the  but it drives like a small car instead of a midsize and feels like a compact sports sedan  steering is much heavier turbolag is nonexistent and it just feels right  oh yea and theres a ton of cargo room in the back
BMW,Engine/Performance,oh how i regret this purchase after decades of owning cars like ford fusion and hyundai sonata i was tricked into believing that a bmw would be a true step up into something called the ultimate driving machine after owning the car for a year i can say that i hate it and i would never buy another one  it is too cramped tapping the brakes is an allout assault on the senses as theyre too sensitive the  speed transmission is pretty harsh the backup camera is nearly useless at night as the images too grainy the headlights are horrible there is no spare tire or even a place to put a spare tire the dashboard controls are strangely located there is no way to lock the dual climate control temperature settings the list just goes on of the things that annoying me to no end that have been implemented for decades by other manufacturers in a better fashionin the end i sold it back to the bmw dealership in less than  months and i was happy to see it go
BMW,Comfort/Interior,"overhyped overmarketed average car i fell for the mass marketing and silly editor reviews on this car  youre supposed to say its a good car because thats what bmw has been pushing so hard for a long time the truth is its a very weakengined plain  boring car  not only does my v accord have tons more power and better mpgs but it doesnt need premium gas  bmw feels like its the size of a boat in the parking lot and the ride is so firm and rattling that you should not call it a luxury car the aged interior looks like it was never changed from the series i always saw in the late s  i saw a review that said hyundais now look nicer inside than bmws"

BMW,Engine/Performance,awsome car this car is excitement on wheels  it
BMW,Comfort/Interior,worlds fastest tennis shoe i loved this eccentric vehicle from the moment i first set eyes on it and i have not been disappointed it steers like a gokart and has one of the sweetest motors available from any manufacturer  porsche included there are a few small details that could be better  like the windows dont wind down all the way and central locking is an aftermarket fitment  not good on a k car all is forgiven once you get this beast out on a mountain road and it comes into its element single minded firecracker with just one purpose  to be driven and hard
BMW,Engine/Performance,"what a car ive had very few problems with the car over the last  years  and the oem tires are still on it at  miles  still a blast to drive  i recent drove the tt turbo and the boxster s and i turned them down for my ole bmw"
BMW,Engine/Performance,"bnw m coupe if bmw is the ultimate driving machine the m coupe is the ultimate of the ultimate driving machines  this car must be driven at all times  it is as responsive as any vehicle i have ever driven  it signals to the driver every nuance of the road and what is about to happen to the car before it happens  this makes for a rigid ride but it also permits you to push the car into a sharp turn at seemingly impossible speeds  tires make a big difference with this car so recommend you choose only those premium tires that will provide the mix of stickiness and wearability"
BMW,Engine/Performance,bmw z  wmpackage  liter engine we recently purchased an  bmw z mpackage this sporty little car is not only comfortable but has an aggressive attitude when you press the sport button my wife has to tell me to slow down some times anyway the body of this vehicle is extremely well designed and gets a lot of looks as where ever we go this car is being looked at from short and long distances the interior is red leather and the exterior is graysilver and we love this color combo bmw certainly has outdone themselves with the z if your looking for speed and looks this is the car for you and you will not go wrong with this vehicle
BMW,Service/Maintenance,i returned this to the dealer   aug hi  bmw has finally decided to take my z m roadster back had it since april on a lease and had been in at the dealership  odd times till august  had multiple problems including  squeaks when the roof was down and when they fixed this  squeaks when the roof was up on the drivers side and when that was fixed  squeaks on the passenger side and when they fixed that  rattle in the ac vents and when they fixed this  the windows would not close when the roof was put up unless i opened each door did the window up and then shut the door and they changed the onboard computer and guess what  the windows still did not close it spent at least  weeks at the shop in  months
BMW,Service/Maintenance,bad ass machine this car is unrealmine runs
BMW,Engine/Performance,engine  transmission great but it stops there the technology interface with the driver is terrible  this car needs a touch screen and get rid of the old school mouse  in an emergency mode the transmission shifting control can be dangerous as you have to push a button on the shift lever side to shift  this is not intuitive  voice control is terrible

BMW,Engine/Performance,disappointing after all the hype ill start the review saying ive owned a big variety of sports cars this car was hyped by the automotive press like crazy but my experience was different pros beautiful styling great exhaust note balanced handling for the road practicality engine is a technical marvel cons rattles and creeks in a low quality interior seat leather nappa wore prematurely not enough torque for the weight of the car which made it feel slower than it is mismatched engine and heavy car numbmushy steering thats artificially heavy in sport mode tendency to plowunderwater on track because of weight horrible gas mileage again mismatched engine electronic gremlins glad i had warranty i felt it was not sporty enough to be a truly rewarding sports car and not luxurious enough to deliver on luxury with its cheap interior bummer

BMW,Engine/Performance,dont buy this bmw poor performance the engine loses all power when i turn a corner at an intersection and i just sit there for a few seconds waiting to go anywhere turbo lag is significant i mash the pedal and for a few seconds nothing happens throttle response is awful i had an awd mb suv before this car and i could take turns faster in a car much much heavier than i can in this handling sucks car is way too low to the ground the seats are the most uncomfortable car seat ive ever sat in my feet go numb frequently because i cant get comfortable interior quality is awful but then i suspect it is with every bmw interior trim and materials are already starting to flake and peel off after only  years of ownership cargo and storage is decent navigation has to be the worst nav on the market i used google maps on my phone at the same time as the vehicle system and ive stopped using the cars nav as it frequently gets the directions or street names wrong the included cell phone charging cradle in the center armrest is friggen retarded the only way my phone fits is if i take the case off and who the hell wants to do that it takes all of the storage from the center console after this there is only enough room for a pack of gum without covering the usb port in here and of course all the cars at dealerships have to come packaged with this dumb charger have the folks at bmw ever used a modern cell phone before what are they thinking usb ports are in the worst place possible you cant both plug something into a usb port and have usable storage or drinks in the cup holders climate control doesnt have a sync option which many cars at this level do my parking assistant and aid frequently doesnt work and nearly every time i back up i get a warning telling me not to rely on it and back up on my own the lack of android auto but inclusion of apple car play is confusing why offer one and not the other use of spotify via the bmw app is spotty no pun intended sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt ive had the car for  years and already had to replace the water pump and after a few months of ownership one of the tires needed to be replaced another  bucks down the drain and now trying to get out of this damn lemon my resale value is nearly half of what i originally paid for the car went from  to  resale value in  years now that is some depreciation long story short dont buy this car get the a sportback which is a way better car albeit for a bit more money
BMW,Service/Maintenance,good looks terrible ride worst car ive ever owned  although the car is a head turner i am anxiously counting the days until my lease is over and i can turn this horrible car back to the dealership  german suspensions are wonderful for flawless german roads but unfortunately the suspension is way way too stiff for flawed american roads  the ride is horrible  i feel every bump in the road  the seats are poorly padded and after a half hour in the car i am ready to get out of it asap  sadly i took it from washington dc to new york and by the time i got to my destination i wanted to leave it on the side of the road  that was the last road trip for it now only use it because it is small and easy to park
BMW,Engine/Performance,what i expected i bought this car as a retirement present present to myself curiously i see a lot of guys mostly my age driving these cars i have thoroughly enjoyed driving for short hops i have taken  trips of  miles and this is not the car for it the rfts amplify the bumps on bad roads and we all know what i can be like other than that it is so much fun to drive and cornering is a terrific experience i have the speed manual and wouldnt consider the automatic  that would just be wrong in a sports car
BMW,Engine/Performance, bmw z i wanted a little excitement in my  life and this car really does the trick  its so much fun to drive i hate to get out of it i leased the  convertible wautomatic trans and premium pkg punch this baby and youre on a roll this car turns heads everywhere i go it looks fast it is  fast and it sticks to the road like glue
BMW,Price/Value,what a car ive had my z coupe  months and have  miles on it  first car i have loved  im  and behind the wheel i feel like   i have driven just about all sport cars but none have turned me on like my coupe  i drove a porsche on a race track once but this coupe will beat that porsche on any curve anytime  and i might add for half the price   the z coupe is and will be the only car for me  when im too old to drive ill sit in my rocker rock the day away while looking at my z
BMW,,bmw z
BMW,Comfort/Interior,"z was the worst car i have ever owned i bought my car brand new with  miles on it  ive had it a year and has  miles on it now  i had to bring it to the show  times  the instrument cluster needed replacing twice the passenger side power seat went out the gas cap lid cover fell off at the gas station the passenger side window fell out  the dealer would not take it back bmw america would not do anything but they made a note of it in  the domestic cars had less complaints then the european cars  makes you wonder why  i should have bought a cadallac"
BMW,Service/Maintenance,i wish i could drive it year round but i live in philly so in the garage it
BMW,Design/Style,bad ass  i bought this car in may of  with  miles for only   i now have  on the odometer  i cannot wait to drive each and every day and wow does the  automatic ever haul ass the torque curve is steady throughout the entire ride from  no lag just ferocious power my only complaint is the amber light cluster for exterior temp and mpg is partially burned out also its very hard to see objects in the rear view mirror due to some peculiar bmw dimming system  other than that drop the top and boogie
BMW,Design/Style,disappointed in quality i only have  miles on my bmw z  i bought it out at the end of my lease the elec motor for the convertible top short circuit due to run off water that enters the plastic housing where the elec motor sits in the water cant drain and the electric motor will rust and quit very expensive repair poor design i had the housing replaced in  and now it needs to be replaced again and of course my extended warranty wont cover the repair nor will the dealership very poor design indeed and not at all what i expected from bmwi also just had to replace the rubber around the windshield and the cowel due to dry roti would have thought the convertible roof of a bmw would last
BMW,Price/Value,disappointed if you buy these cars expect to shell out big bucks for repairs we have an extended warranty which so far has been of no use because of water leakage the top wouldnt open because of a leak bmw at least paid for labor parts still cost us  now the wipers stopped working some part cracked and water again somehow got in going to cost  to fix and again its not covered under the warranty great looking and handling car but poorly built will never buy a bmw again
BMW,Comfort/Interior,over  club ok we have had the z for seven months it has been driven in the usa and we brought it to germany in november  my wife drives it to and from frankfurt every four days on a so for the two hour and  minute trip four times per week it is being driven at  mph on average too bad it is a us specs bimmer
BMW,Service/Maintenance,a bmw that should not be called bmw i am leasing this car right now i love it except for one thing  the dealership had more than me for the past year why the reliability has been very very poor to the point where i have to take it to dealership every month stereo going bad top leaking noise from door trunk leaking sadly the quality i am used to from bmw is not present here it is fun to drive if it was not for all things going wrong with it
BMW,Engine/Performance,excessive noise i actually bought this as mothers day gift for my wife last year  she actually gets to drive it once in a while   the only complaint i have is the excessive noise that comes from from the passenger seat when my wife is riding with me  are you crazy  slow down i am never riding with you again in this car often can be heard even over the sound of the engine as i shift through the five gears  my only regret now is that i did not buy the  for a little boost
BMW,Comfort/Interior,class comfort and quality
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,in shop  weeks out of  months and still counting purchased in april running board fell off  days in shop of all things they cant get this rightengine stalls at low rpms  days in shoproof leaks  days in shopcreak in rear suspension  days in shop and still counting
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,middle of all things xm is not a suv not a sports car and not a family car then what is it it is a mix of everything in another words it is not great for any of them and it is not bad for all of them well depends on the situation it is not the greatest sports car it is a useless suv and it is a terrible family car why did i buy it i guess i am in blind love with bmw m division fuel economy is terrible but if you have to look at those figures this is not the car for you  my family hates this car for its stiff ride and noisy interior but nevertheless i love driving this car more than my porsche  my infiniti qx and definitely my wifes toyota sienna
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,sick fast as long as you dont mind the terrible mileage its an amazing car to drivewolf in sheeps clothingto the casual observer a soccer mom suv but its as close to the acceleration of a roller coaster that you can get to
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,wait for the  the  xm is going to be  cheaper but hold off the  will be redesigned
BMW,Engine/Performance,not up to bmw m standards too heavy not a precise and agile m car as its forebears were most of the performance is completely unusable in daily driving prepare to be beat at every stoplight unless you are really on it  i think j clarkson said it best completely annoying until you hit the m button too bad you cant use that button for  of your driving meaning you will have a really annoying car for  of the time you are driving sold mine a bought porsche a massive improvement in just about every way

BMW,Design/Style,"the ultimate driving machine there are truely no substitues for this machine  it is a classic which can now start appreciating in value now bmw has stopped building this model and the upcoming new model seems to be a couple steps backwards in styling  this is a car you can drive to work everyday and dont have to have a porsche or a ferrari in your garage for your weekend driving pleasures  it truely is a drivers car rather than for someone seeking for a shallow status  certainly not for someone who likes automatics"
BMW,Service/Maintenance,ultimate driver the only limitation with this car is the local inadequate road system and poor drivers who get in the way
BMW,Engine/Performance,now yesterdays technology but what an engine pricey repairs will give back some of the bang for the buck as will gas mileage but there is no better way to grab a stout hp v than this car
BMW,Engine/Performance,dont make the same mistake i bought an  bmw m in may with  miles on the drive home the oil cooler broke and started leaking oil that was a  repair an addition to the money i just spent purchasing the car and approximately  in taxes a few weeks later the passenger restraint malfunction showed up the battery cable had to be replaced i spent nearly  on that particular issue maybe more shortly after i began to get transmission malfunctions as well as engine malfunctions which placed the car in limp mode i spent  fixing the transmission problems and just a few months later im having problems again ive lost  this year because of the m and im done
BMW,Mileage/Fuel,m get one
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,nd owner i have always purchased low mile cars when i purchased my clk in september of  from a so cal mb it had k miles in less than  years i added another k miles i have had no issues with the car until unfortuneately the car was recently involved in an accident that left it totaled i have had little luck locating a replacement wlow miles i will continue my hunt
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,"hoped for more its fun to drive but disappointed with the problems i am having i hit  miles a few months ago and have had one problem after another the engine fan completely went the catalyst converter is coming apart and the lights parklights headlights tail lights etc must be replaced every other month"

Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,what happened just ask me for the list
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,clk review greay car dream car
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,worst car i ever owned i bought my   weeks ago i have since traded up to an acura tl  yes i said up the tl blows the clk i had out of the water this was the worst car experience ive ever had i owned the car two weeks when the transmission went out i had it towed to mercedes where i had my  manufacturers warranty for them to tell me to wait a week with no loaner car  said they dont give loaners anymore for an answer they were not helpful whatsoever and lacked hugely in their customer service i was so unhappy with the car i traded for a real one acura tlall the things wrong  the windows were rattling and loose failed transmission  rear foglamp out side turn signal light broken allot
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,so dissapointed i traded in my g coupe on this car and from the second day of owning i wish i could have just got my old car back  in the three years that i owned my g i never had as many problems as with this stupid car  it was certified preowned when i bought it and it only had  miles on it  heres the list blown speaker wheel balance off drivers side seat holder broken engine pulley replacement middle brake light out and chip in windshield  i know you might be thinkingmost of these things were rigged so i didnt find them instantly and i got to those so far and only owned it a few months terrible customer service and a terrible car dont buy it
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,transmission problem i love the car but have had a horrible experience from service at the dealership  sometimes the car jerks downshifts and drives very rough when you are slowing down  i had it checked at  miles and again at  miles gas mileage is pretty good but runs on premium design is great but does not make up for horrible service
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,bad compressor at less than  my compressor has gone bad  miles the car may be  yrs old but at that low mileage it should not have a compressor leak it has been properly maintained at mercedes dealerships and garage kept i am the fourth owner had it for two years and average  a year in mileage i have only had to visit the dealership twice for service and apparently do not have enough loyalty to get a decent repair rate on something  that should not be broken i spoke with the head of the post warranty at mbusa and he spoke with my local service center the best deal they could offer me was  off the  repair bill i am very disappointed in the quality of the car
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,poor reliability after owning a clk for  months my average maintenance is  per month two manufacturing defects beyond the warranty cost  each to fix a noise from the ac compressor clutch bracket was repaitedsecondlt a month later the tire pressure warning came on i reprressurized  times rgen the dash indicator turned red for tires next the dash said srs malfunction the dealer says wiring under the sets is defecrive and seats need to be removed etc this follows an experience with a e which was disastrous window falling etclast mercedes

Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,"nd mercedes benz lemon car is fun to drive but you better not drive it out of town  it will shut off when its ready  the dealer doesnt work to find the problem they just say we are sorry we can not find anything wrong with your car  this is not the first time the c  is worse  the sunshades break the window stops working the keys are recalled and the dealer never lets you know  all in all the mb c and clk   are definitely a work of chrysler"

Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,my convertible i agree with the poor visability out
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,not a sl problem with phone and elec
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,mixed feelings i went from a boxster to a clk cabriolet because i started to play a lot of golf and needed more room but couldnt bring myself to buy an suv mistake the trunk is small  wont hold two sets of clubs easily even with one set i have to pull out my longer clubs and put them in separately the back seat very difficult to get into front seat wont stay forward unless you readjust it what a pain windscreen completely obnoxious to installremove the most annoying thing is the ding ding ding when you open the door i hate it and dealer wont shut if off  enough to make me sell the car if you press a button on steering wheel though you can shut it up beautiful car otherwise
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,"poor quality had nothing but troubles catylitic converter went out speaker problems rattle in wood trim ec button problem abs problems malfunctioning key you get the idea the car also has accessive ratling"
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,"wifes tiger this is actually a review of my wifes  clk  it was the st red  imported into the us  she loves it and gets great compliments from her girl friends  she too has had the window problem apparently this is very common  dealer replaced both sensors and no more problems  only real negative  road noise is terrible but tolerable  not like a lexus or e  gas mileage is also poor  not as good as sticker  otherwise great car"
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,stay away the car was in shop in total for over
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,outstanding in every regard this is my first offshore vehicle  as far as i am concerned this car is in a class by itself  it was a said day when i passed the cadillac and lincoln dealerships realizing there was not a car in there for me  as expensive as it is this car blows away the jag xk which is almost twice the price  and as far as a bmw  comparison i have yet to find anyone who has been in my car that agrees the  belongs in the trash can when compared to the clk  unfortunately the  e convertible replacement of this clk model looks harsh like the design was forced onto the car  and the price is another k  get a clk while they are still available
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior, clk  amg  i purchased my clk  amg convertible is southampton ny the car is fast handles very well and is terrible on gas but i knew that from the start the interior could use some work especially the rear seats just make it a  seater navigation system is onpoint sound system is clean but confusing still havent figured out how to change the clock time i do get compliments on the car evertime i leave the driveway
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,merc clk wicked car with everything it is
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"falling short of expectations paid top dollar for what turned out to be a real dissapointment poor quality and terrible dealer support claridges in fremont ca well never buy another car from them again"
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,blown away i just bought this car but drove lexus bmw and other mbz models before purchasing and there is not comparison  it handles amazing and the shifters give it the feel of a manual transmission without the annoying clutch  feels roomier inside than other models and reeks of luxury and performance  i will have a hard time going down in class of car after this one  it is the most fun car i have driven and it is hard to leave it parked for long
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,dont be fooled dont be fooled by the fact that the emblem says mercedes benz  the car is poorly designed and poorly built interior is cramped upgraded sound system is tinny radio reception is awful climate control is poor navigation system is impossible to use  at least  service visits in less than a year due to defects  this is more like a reliant k than a mercedes benz
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,clk  what a beautythe only thing i
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,trouble in paradise this car is beautiful and a pleasure to drive  it is nimble and responsive unfortunately little and big problems have occured the battery died when the car wasnt driven for ten days the transmission failed without warning on the highway  miles from home  the teleaid system couldnt pinpont our location the car took a week to repair and i wasnt given a loaner  later the trunk wouldnt open without use of the valet key  the computer keeps losing the seat memory
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,slow car not a sports car at all  dont be fooled by mercedes in order for them to sell the car  automatic trans and low horsepower add up to a boring car  bmw  series would have been a smarter purchase  this is definitely an old lady car
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior, clk cabriolet compared to  i owned an  and it was a disaster  poor trim and finish leaks silly interior flubs in design  altogether an awful car  it was shocking  but having been a benz driver since  i felt the urge to give it one more try before moving like everyone else to lexus  i have been pleasantly surprised by the major improvement in quality in this new model  the top is infinitely better in all respects the interior trim is higher quality all around the noise level is lower the finish is far superior  its as if a different car company made it  anyway they saved this one customer by putting some quality back in  i hope mbz learned a lesson
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"unhappy  frustrated to date  days after purchase my power steering pump failed nearly causing a fatal crash  the teleaid system and rear assit mirror adjustment were also found defective from day one  while a new power steering pump and teleaid system installation seems to have corrected the problem the mirror still does not work and will go a rd time for repair its not fun to drive because im constantly driving it to the repair shop  btw this is not a cabriolet only choice given"

Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,very disappointed with this car waited  months for car to be delivered within  months of delivery we had a leak in the transmission that left the car inoperable after two visits they replaced the trans next the zenon headlight started shorting out it had to be replaced next was alignment issues this car will wear out top quality tires in less than k miles of normal driving my car has had to be aligned  times in  years next was the seatbelt the mechanism that hands you the belt had to be replaced and finally today my wife is at the dealership having a gear replaced in the tilt steering mechanism i am so disappointed in this car i thought i was buying the best but i got a lemon  buyer beware

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,not a fine wine bought the car used with k miles for my kid as i wanted her in a mini tank along with traction and stab control side airbags etc  just my luck had to fix almost everything  brakes rear deck leak amplifiers blown speakers rear antenna ball joints dashboard digital metrics outside temp gear display etc shot intermit wiper etc  i think it also just sprung a leak somewhere up front on the passenger side and i think i just lost the driver rear wheel bearings  ive owned late model american and asian based cars that never experienced as many problems as this little gem  also  bose radio sounds like crud  lots of static

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,mercedes clk  this car has been everything would
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,mercedes clk  this car has been everything would
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,poor quality car it is not what it is made out to be we purchased a new glc  last year been to the dealership about  times so far many broken parts required fixing brakes repeated made noise had to contact bbb for mercedes to make a repair worst luxury car we have owned look around at other brands before you buy
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,amg and things no one told you we have just turned  miles and have been told we already need new tires  we have been experiencing horrible noises and grabbing when turning sharply after our dealer checked it out for  days they claimed it was because of our tires and cold weather  however we live in houstontx where it is rarely cold and experienced these noises when it was  degrees outside  we are now putting  new tires on the vehicle because it seems we have no choice as they will not align it without new tires we hope this fixes this but we are more than upset that these expensive tires get only  miles before needing replacing the dealer indicated we should have known that an amg would need new tires frequently  funny no one mentioned this when we were buying the car
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,think twice this suv down not get good gas mileage as advertised the seats are her uncomfortable the technology specifically the display of radio navigation and other options on the display are too confusing and not easy to navigate when driving if your door is left open and you try to open and shut while the car is on park the car slams itself into park mode not worth the money my car was retailed at k never again
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,bad tires or badly designed car my car has  miles and i was just told  tires are showing wear after already replacing all  tires  months ago when i replaced the original tires i went to a reputable tire dealer and replaced them i spent a lot of money on them and the tires have a great reputation so i was shocked to learn by the mb service department today  of them are wearing out really maybe its not the tires maybe something is wrong with the car design
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,disappointed mercedesglc  owner i bought this car in april of   months later i am very disappointed with the car as a whole as i have had a multitude of issues first the car brakes began to squeal as soon as winter came around the washer fluid was leaking into the back of the car which caused the antenna to fail and therefore my car fob stopped working
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,not what i expected if you are used to quality made wellthoughtout vehicles go elsewhere  mercedes has dropped its ability to think and innovate to save money on this vehicle  its simple to look at the previous generation and see that that was a better car  the glk had bigger windows bigger engine more comfortable seating and styling that doesnt look like they used an ugly acura as a template  the windows on this car are tiny which is what i would expect from a current econobox   the styling of this car suffers from the awkward tiny windows and bulbous rear end  the command navigation is the worst ive ever used in any car ive owned it actually shows you advertisements while you are navigating for starbucks dennys and others  you cant turn that off  the controls are terrible compared to bmw idrive or even just a ford it takes so much work to just advance to the next track of the music you are listening to youll end up just shutting off the stereo  im a software engineer and i find the thing so backwards and bizarre to use i just cant imagine someone who isnt a techie finding it simple  they have all the features ticked to be on par with bmw but each are all done so poorly  its just an endless disappointment  it has strange quirks too  start closing the sunroof and get out of the car and it stops closing  but you can close it from the outside  why   the mercedes me app and the command internet access is a total joke  both take forever to load   if you really want this car get it with no electronic options ticked  dont get navigation for sure  by the time the voice guidance completes its total blather and gets to the actual turn youre already past the turn  it doesnt work well enough to justify the advertisements on screen either  get it bare bones so there are fewer things to be disappointed by  the engine transmission seats and steering are just excellent  better than my  series  the rest of the car is just a joke  also spend some time in the seat  the forward facing headrests are what you would expect from a honda not a mercedes benz  the prior model glk had active headrests which dont place you in an awkward position   mb cheaped out and used passive headrests for this car  prior to this car i owned a bmw i wagon base a bmw activehybrid sport and a bmw d every option   i have never sat in a lexus and found it to be luxurious  acuras look and feel cheap and tinny to me  im not stuck up i just want the quality and innovation to be present when i pay k for a car  i encourage you to demand more and get the best thing you can find with few compromises  in that light this glc is just junk   i just traded it in after only  months with it
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,bad experience with mercedesbenz very bad experience with mercedes glc  we purchased a new mercedes glc  from mercedes bens of el cajon ca  on april th  its only a half year time now the sound simplifier is not work the dealer service told us we have to pay  to repair out of pocket it should be covered under warranty but the dealer said there is leak from the trunk cause the damage so the warranty doesnt coverthere must be a design deficiency it doesnt make sense the trunk is leaking what a car what a bad service
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,i hate this glc we drove  glks for a total of  years the glc was a bad mistake  the lever to lower the front of driver seat is non functional the car throws you around when going around curves on the interstate going  the car practically throws you out when going over a speed bump had a flat tire and had to wait a week for a replacement bluetooth wont stay connected garmin is worse than having no navigation  i could go on and on  dont do it
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,glc has faulty axle which breaks needs recall mercedes benz glc  model has a serious axle breaking issue and the response from mercedes benz of chantilly is pathetic me and my wife were going to dulles airport on feb when axle of my brand new mercedes broke in middle of road had it been route  this would have caused a very serious accident for not only for us but many others even after  months of rigorous follow up all i am offered is a replacement vehicle with huge financial implication on me as glc as of new purchase and for some time they offered loaner vehicle but that also is taken back and now this case is given to third party stericycle to settle who will take  weeks to provide refund i requested to know the cause of this defect so that others do not suffer but no explanation is provided i am suffering from last   months and would not recommend anyone to buy this car from mercedes who claim to be the safest of all cars but it is not correct and also they do not care about customers please do not buy this vehicle unless you have assurance from dealermb regarding treatment of quality issues
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,buzzing noise i bought a new glc   but there was the buzzing noise in break park and hold this is not only irritating but occurred problems in my ear after i drove my car for a week i had a serious problem with my ear in my daily life although i am not in the car i hear the buzzing noise and my ear is hearting i have a serious headache the dealership tested and found that most other glc  also has this buzzing noise particularly my car had a louder buzzing noise i contacted the mercedes usa and told them to recall glc  but they ignored because i already paid and bought the car they didnt care do not buy this default car
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,glc  review
Mercedes-Benz,,glc
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,never owned better i have owned lexus cadillac and several mbz including a  e fully optioned out this one is also completely optioned out my only complaint is that as quiet as the interior is and it is library quiet the slight wind noise coming from the windshield is annoying at speed this carsuv does not come with laminated windows that are acoustically silent and you cant order them this makes no sense when everything about the suv screams quality and luxury because road noise and all other noises are so well managed you really notice the wind noise its not bad just intrusive enough that you feel annoyed in a  car other than the poor and i mean really poor gas mileage this is the best car i have ever owned i have  miles on the car and in combined cityfreeway driving averaging about  miles and hour for the last  of those miles i am getting  mpg this includes  miles driven at autobahn speed of  mph where i averaged  mpg so i am pretty disappointed in the mpg mbz says that i should give it until i hit  miles when the engine is really broken in to see better mpg well see
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,problems bought this car five months ago tried to start it one morning it was totally dead mercedess said it was a bad battery they put in a new one and i drove it home next morning totally dead again mercedes told me i must be leaving the lights on now its been in the shop for almost a month now and they have no idea whats wrong they put in a new computer and when they did that it blew up the fuse box so they ordered a new fuse box and now they said there is something wrong with the power steering another crazy thing is that they gave me a loaner glc and there is something wrong with this one too it makes a very loud engine noise sounds like one of the fans sounds like a space ship taking off
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,disappointed in my mercedes glc my biggest disappointment with my glc is that it does not have appleandroid play and cannot be retrofitted  the car doesnt even allow me to voice to text when i receive a text  i have to select command and then tell it to send a text to   i would not have bought this car if i knew the technology was so antiquated  in addition ive had to take my car in twice in the first  days once to have the transmission adjusted because it was skipping gears and once to have the brake pads replaced because they were squeaking so bad in cold weather
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,love that mercedes benz  glc be sure if you want a trailer hitch that it is already on the model you purchase to install after sale is almost impossible and very expensive you will need to go to someone like tricktrucks who will agree to take off the side and rear panels and maybe some painting required
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,glc disappointment we have all the numbers mercedes over the years and decided to get the glc versus the glk due to it being discontinued  we were one of the first buyers in the denver market and had to wait for it to be shipped from germany unfortunately i did not use my do not buy the first year of the model when buying this vehicle we have not only had poor service from the dealership in trying to determine a problem but are having continual transmission issues which now need to be resolved through germany this is the second time we have brought this vehicle in for the same issue the service technicians tell us that they have had numerous complaints for the same issue that have gone un resolved there is a potential lemon law in colorado that may also be enacted on this vehicle with a number of vehicles in the same class audi and bmw i feel i did not make a good buying decision
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,great car but somewhat unmercedes ive driven mercedes  years i have had e e s and c but i needed high seats and an ease of entryexit for my bad back so i got a glc  well well while the ride is mercedes like suspension is awful it jerks bobs bounces vibrates and wiggles some vibration is very unpleasant frequency  therere other issues too  my tires went bald at k miles what happened well a simple accounting trick mb installs runflat tires but doesnt include a spare and installation kit it saves mb money but at the expense of the buyers replacing tires  times faster  so after  year of service i spent  on michelins and must buy a spare kit from mb of course for   there didnt expect this from mb
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,beauty is empty inside does not come with anything no keyless go on standard model  you have to have a key to open the door no touch open and go  after  months of driving the air condition have mildew smell and the trunk sealer at bottom fall apart  the monitor is not touch control issue with blue tooth connection
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,thumping noise in front end started at about  miles dealer rotated tires still thumping dealer said tires were feathered needs alignment brought car in for alignment but was told car needed new front and rear differentials differentials installed  weeks later thumping has been significantly reduced i asked for alignment to eliminate that as an issue i was charged  for what should have been a warranty repair i was told car needed new tires at  milestypical of runflatsthis problem coupled with the screeching brake issue previously reported has made owning this otherwise fine vehicle a headacheupdate replaced runflats with  continentals standard on audis wow quieter smoother riding  mile warranty bought continental road repair kit instead of spare tire  plus have mb and aaa road service  i still think proximity warning system is very bad seriously thinking of audi q soon brake squealing backing up is coming back i would not recommend this car to prospective buyers because of brake noise run flat tires and poor proximity warning
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,my mercedes is an embarrassment the brakes screech when backing up they are so loud that the neighbors dont want us to pull out early morning or evening people complain we wake babies and make dogs bark dealership has been saying for months that germany is working on a fix and parts are coming its been over six months no one call us back anymore they did mention it is motor trends car of the year and they cant keep them in stock question should they be selling them knowing this is a serious issues
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,screeching brakes  buyers beware cold weather locales will no doubt find screeching brake issues manufacturer is aware and even though it existed in the  models the fix still eludes their engineers in the  models neighbors hate us and its forcing me to attempt less braking while backing out of my shared and loooong driveway take away this  issue and this car would be near perfect yes controls are clunky but it can grow on you
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,mb should be embarrassed   mos old and regret this is my first and likely my last mb i did the research and ultimately decided on the glc matic suv  bmw x  acura rdx and audi q were closely considered  the smooth ride mb reputation customer service boy was i wrong and safety record sealed my decision  at  mos old and only k miles on my car the screeching brakes are so incredibly loud that i have switched cars with my husband  the brakes wake my young daughter up from a sound sleep as i am backing out of the garage in the morning  my neighbors and colleagues have asked multiple times what is wrong with your brand new car  this is not a small squeak but a screech that turns peoples heads  this is evidently a known problem to mb and they have no solution to date  my car is currently at the dealership for a temporary fix which the service manager admitted will only put a brief bandaid on a larger problem that mb has yet to formally acknowledge to its high paying customers  no letter from mb  no phone call  no email  nothing  just me calling and complaining with the dealership ultimately putting me on a waiting list for several weeks to have a temporary fix implemented  sorry mb but this lack of acknowledgement of a problem and disrespect is not going to earn you my loyalty  how do i know if the car is even safe to drive  mb  im very disappointed  ive waited a long time to purchase a brand new car that ive worked very hard for  potential customers be warned and go with another option imho
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,some great some terrible i have a love hate relationship wth this car it has a greatcomfortable ridethe mileage is great the is plenty of power the mechanical aspects goodmy big complaint is that the controls on this car are terrible the controls are very poor designed and hard to use the mbrace is no substitute for onstar
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,too  expensive very expensive suv for what it cut out very little technology for the price  no adaptive cruise control standard comes as bery extra very expensive to be able have  adaptive cruise control of your highway driver did not recommend this suv
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,not quite what i expected from a mercedes
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,peerless glc compared with bwm x and audi q
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,reliability i purchased this suv new expecting to get a quality vehilcle i am a high mileage driver and this is what you should expectair conditioning stops working after  hours of driving brought it to the dealer who said nothing was wrong took a vacation from ma to south carolina it stoppedstopped at a sc dealer who left a long vm for my dealer saying it doesnt work brought it to the dealer they tested it and said it was fine it is notalternator broke at  miles brought it to the dealer and they actually fixed under warrantee they were not very happy to do itheater fan the dreaded squeak as i have read on line almost constant cost about  to fixso sorry i bought
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,a bmw killer i dont think so the navigation system we paid  for or more precisely got robbed forit is a piece of junk worst gps we ever used and we have used quite a few different brands and models this is simply the worse than the worst the interface is extremely clumsy and slow to use the features are limited some address cannot be found wrong routes etcthe traffic update tmc is a joke since you have to manually check the text messages for each road on the list at  time price of a touch screen garmin  with life time map and traffic update we got  of the features functionalities accuracy and quality
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,a wheel gas guzzler leased a wheel drive  glk from caliber motors wbad lease tuin april this year to replace the  e due to too many unsafe blind spots after driven  months of the glk here are my personal driving experience of this halfbreed suvprosnot too high not to low the height is just about right not too many blind spots as the  e better visibility quiet good chairs maneuverability okay consa terrible wheel drive gas guzzlergas consumption worse than e worse than  mlsoft brakes hesitant accelerating ugly side mirrorsrear blind spotsworst turning radius stupid gps navigatorknob controlsmall screena german joke bad heat penetrating moon roof
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,better than our former  e we just returned and terminated our year leased  e  months earlier last week and decided to lease this wheel drive glk we have driven the e for the rd year but could never get used to it because every time we got into it we felt cramped and always got the phobia with lot of blind spots all around its wheel base is too long to make easy turns into any shopping center entrance opening as the right rear wheel would often hit and ride on the curb and keep damaging the wheel rim and the tire the e drive side rearview mirror is equipped with a dark autodim film so it makes the driving at night often impaired and dangerous and its a very stupid overkilled fixture
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,disappointed this vehicle has been a huge disappointment to me  it broke down and had to be towed in  degree temperatures when it had  miles it needed a new gear shifter and the part took five days to find  then the check engine light came on when it had  miles and it had a defective charcoal canister a fuel problem which had to be replaced that part took three days to find fortunately the vehicle is still under warranty  i am going to be getting rid of it because i cannot trust it and i will never get another mercedesbenz again
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,paint and body work worst than anything dont buy mercedes i have s and glk both purchased new  the s got very bad transmission when shift in automatic from nd to rd gear  engine vibrate and shake the whole car when unexpected  rear tires only last k miles it always wear out in the center i use recommended tire pressure of psi   glk very bad paint job  the clear coat got dust all over the car  the hood gap on left and right are at least  different  its a brand new car this kind of gap only happens on car with front end accident  you dont expect these problem from brand new mercedes
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,worst car ever great service at the dealer got hypnotized by the mercedez salesman  got the car big disappointment the fuel economy is the worst no leg room in the rear seat  cant go on a long trip with this car you have to press brakes long before stopping no luxurious at all front seats very small  male wont fit this is not a suv feels this is like a little car just to go and buy groceries just because it got the mercedez emblem thats not mean is driven and feel like a mercedez doesnt come with seat warmers to open the car youll would have to open all the locks not just the drivers  youll have to open the locks when in vehicle to release passengers in back seat big mistake
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,fast like car this is a bad ass ride moves in and out of lines like a race car

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,smoth ride wind noise slow rain wiper this car ride very smoothly but like the other reviewer my glk also has wind noise and its always in the passenger front side i took it in to the dealer and they had the window shield replaced  the situation still not improved  i didnt hear that noise when i drove avalon or any other verticals  it was raining really hard today and my rain wipers werent fast enough for me to see the road this were never happen in my past  with the other cars i will not buy this car again correction  dealer replaced windshield seal at first did not work finally they replaced the front windshield glass that got rid of the annoying wind noise
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,never buy this car i bought this car with  miles on it i drove it off the lot of the whole sale dealer and the day after started having problems it may be because its used and i dont know how the person before me treated the car ive had the car for a year and put over  into it already in repairs as soon as its fixed something else seems to go wrong not to mention the gas mileage is terrible
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,huge disappointment this was my first and probably last mb  was paid and within  years the ac system was replaced twice electrical systems are a constant headache front right blinker stopped working and was redesigned not recalled due to ongong failureand then one day started working correctly again quality of the product is poor i had hoped for an experience like my last car a toyota drove the toyota for k miles i would not recommend a mb to anyone
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,great car given bum rap by bad dealers this is a fantastic car that is severely underrated because the mb dealer network is horrible  stupid problems take  trips to be resolved  the two happiest days of my mb ownernhip were the day i drove it home and the day my warranty expired  take it to an outside mechanic and youll realize that these cars really are still built well  i only had a few very minor complaints with the car that like i said took multiple trips an average of  each really to resolve  i had the same number of issues with our  hondas  the only difference was the way those issues were handled  this is great news for used buyers  scoop up a wellloved example of this car
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,"big name little performance i have had my  mercedesbenz c coupefor   years after only one year the gas tank leakedin my garage and my car needed to be towed out  at miles they had to repack the wheelbearings and tighten sunroof now with miles they need to be replacedagain the sunrrof squeaks my car makes a horriblesound until it warms up everytime you startit  the dealership service manager said that thisis normal for this model  it sounds like a diesel or a year old car  the supercharger lacksperformance and consistency in itsoutput six speed  the cloth seats stain ifany water touches them i traded up from a ford mustang gt in every aspect ofperformance the mustang was better this is a horriblecar hiding under a mercedes benz logo iwill never own another mercedes again"

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,muscle car in mercedes clothing i heard so much about this car that i had to test drive it  hours later i owned it with a friends performance computer stuck to the window i pulled a   seconds and a  mile a little over  this car is grace and elegance inside and out heck its a mercedes what would you expect but underneath the hood and behind the tires beats the lovechild of a porsche or a corvette this car is a monster forget all the reviews find one and go drive it but preferably at a dealership i am afraid a private owner might cry while you push the throttle and his z rated tires light up like the th of july
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,"could have been a contender i ordered my c after having seen only pictures of one from europe and after having enjoyed my  c so much that i knew this new amg was going to be the cats balls  i was a little disappointed the steering is decent for a benz but it has a bit too much understeer out the box  living in boston the car is very uncomfortable on imperfect roads it just doesnt soak up bumps the way a benz should  its also had a big handful of small problems too many for a benz in fact"

Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,finally gone this car was bought from a cadillac dealership  it had been traded for a cadillac  that should have been our first clue  though fun to drive at times the car is extremely unreliable falling apart around us very expensive to repair and one of the most uncomfortable luxury or near luxury vehicles i have ever driven  the c class is the epitome of over engineering poor quality build and a manufacturer currently resting on a mythical reputation  this was our families second and last mercedes  we just traded it for a pittance on a lincoln mkz  it might not be german and for that we are truly grateful  perhaps the only thing to miss is the sound the mb door makes when closing
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,c rating i am dissapointed with the quality of the c overall  for example the driver and passenger seat control module failed resulting in an out of warranty cost of   the valve cover gaskets need replacing at k miles  the drivers window switch needs replacing  the thrust arm bushing is cracked  the drivers grab handle needs to be replaced  this car is driven by my wife and only has k miles  in fact last year we only put about k miles on the car  we have had  other benz and this may be the last one we own the quality lacks a lot to be desired from what we experience in our other  mercedes benz
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,"mb wagon i have had very little trouble with thisautomobile i have found the climatecontrols to be unnecessarily confusingwhat little problems i have had havebeen due to electrical difficultiesit is a fun responsive car to drive anddoes not tire one out on trips i wouldcertainly look at another one when idecide to trade cars"
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,had snow  ice storm only car that could drive this was a fluke purchase as found for sale and told hubby about it against my wishes he bought it well guess who is eating crow now we had a bought of bad weather snowice that is not common to area this matic beat my older stick wheel drive pick up on performance in bad road conditions he said it was like a  wheel drive now a believer what a great car
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,horrible car i bought the car with k miles on it in  and as i though the car should last really long with no problems but unfortunately it was nothing than nightmare i diagnosed the car before buying and everything was finemy first mechanical problem occurred after  months  automatic door went out i payed  to fix it after a week rear window automatic sunshade went off as well i decided to leave it as is since it too expensive to repair in  more months alternator and battery died in  more months blow motor problems started to take place hot air only and wasnt able to turn air conditioner off until shut off the car so i replaced blow motor but after  weeks  climate control panel stopped working after some period of time the car just stalled on the road the car was towed and crankshaft sensor was dead in  month water pump started to jamm and the car stalled couple of time again in addition rust started to occur all over the car and the car looked horrible transmission problems took place as well sometimes it was shifted strange and it stocked on the same gear two times so i pulled out the car and restarted the engine the last straw was power steering beld drive failure  so after i spend  on repairs i decided to sell it even though i paid a little more than k when i bought it maximum i got is k it was such a relief to rid off from this carthe only con was that the car was extremely fast and fund to drive but it can not compensate all mechanical issues
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,repeated costly repairs  nightmare expensive repairs seat electronics cost  remote key did not work omni bar changed  spark plug wires defective recommeded fix  defective lower front control arms fix  these are not routine maintenance issues but defective manufacturing which i do not expect on a  german car pls do not buy mercedese if they are not able to guarantee defective products in their vehicles
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,most unreliable care i ever owned bought the car with  miles  always wanted to stall at stop signs  took  years for them to find out what was wrong  replaced fuel pumps on good will since warranty expired  new pumps whined and they would not replace them again  coil spring broke power steering pump went bad crankshaft position sensor bad  rust bucket  car started rusting after two years  front end noise  traded it in cause i was tired of all the problems  rode great but very expensive to own  poor mechanical quality  worst car i ever owned
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,the nicest terrible car i ever owned i bought this benz used in  and it was in really good condition and low miles ever since then it has slowly fallen apart mechanically it is decent other than the expensive maintenance but the fit and finish of the car is sub par everything form the trim to the cup holders to the seats have broken at one time or another this is the bottom of the mb lineup and it shows they really just cranked these out and spit them at the consumers without quality control makes me never want to buy a mb or any german car for that matter again what a shame
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,buy lexus im sorry but this car is junk replaced cluster module rear stan and engine cd player now doesnt work light over license plate has been replaced twice too many electrical problems for a vehicle that was purchased brand new quality is gone and ill never purchase a mercedes benz again my next vehicle will be a lexus ive had a lexus in the past with no problems at all
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,vastly overrated having operated a c for three years i now see why mb has become an average car in the ratings  it has been one small thing after another and a couple not so small  after spending  for four new tires that did not solve a constant vibration someone cared enough to see what was actually wrong and found out the car had a warped drive shaft at  miles  of course nothing was said about the tires  this is my fourth and last one unless my wife changes my mind
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,"not worth it just buy a honda the electrical system in this car is sad  it has been in for service  times in  years  this includes  fan motors for ac new control panel for accomputer control panel x the dashboard display and  alternators  the door handle fell off and the glove box broke probably from the numerous times the dashboard was removed having driven a minivan  miles and  gm conversions vansthe last for  years and  miles i thought i would upgrade to a quality vehicle  sadly i was disappointed i was planning on giving this car to my teenage daughter because of the safety features and her deep love for the handling but it is simply too unreliable"
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,"electrical trouble never goes away have put  miles on this car  it has been in the shop over  times in the first  months  everything from the headrest motor to the fuel pump to the crankshaft has been replaced car is very slow on the start  dont think of jumping out into traffic"

Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,"not impressed i bought this car as a present to myself  who knew i would be so underwhelmed by the experience  too many minor repairs in the first few months purge valve wind noise because stuff around door jam not secure and rear sun shade worked only when it wanted to  these things were fixed and now im experiencing other prblems  the back of the passenger seat fell off the driver side door handle broke off no unusual use and the gear shift moves when you change gears  and dont get me started about the squeaking brakes  ugh"
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"not a happy camper back three times for a vibration between    mph  dealer cant correct problem basesp warning came on twice first it was the computer second time it was dirty contacts phone had to be replaced  approx  months after my car was delivered"
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,mercedes  well designed and confortable to
Mercedes-Benz,,na
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,piece of junk jack  with xxx miles engine balance shaft bad mb lost the class action law suit so they will pay for partial repair never should have gone bad i the first place engine intake breaks due to cheap plastic rods valve body in transmission is a problem and gets stuck in gear a  dealer only  repair electrical failures do not purchase this car
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,engine fire i will never own another mercedes  my  c caught fire  as it turned out it was still under warranty as i had purchased the  yr mile extra  i had it towed to hoehn mercedes carlsbad adding insult to injury i was told it was their opinion the car caught fire because i ran over a cigarette butt so the warranty was void i contacted mercedes directly  they were equally as insulting and unconcerned  they told me it could take months to ever really figure out what started the fire and in the meantime the warranty was void needing to move on with my life i filed an insurance claim they intend to get to the bottom of this  this experience has been most disappointing
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,retension belt  i had this car for less than one year enough time for me to have all sorts of service issues  i was sold this car as a certified vehicle which is marketing bs talk for used car  in a nutshell i had problems with the retension belt  i drove  until the belt had to be replaced i argued that this is something that needed to be covered under warranty and even the benz service guy agreed it wasnt so i had to shell out   i bought a hyundai vera cruz at about the same time as the c im on the verge of exchanging the c with a sonata  ata least my expectations wont be high with a sonata
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,oudstanding i get  mpg on highway and  mpg in  city driving i dont understand how people can rate the mpg less than ten  this is my third mb and i love it as much as my prior two it requires very little maintenance expenditures all i have spent  for since i purchased it was for  tires and the usual oil and filter changes
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,maintenance beware  extremely happy with vehicle performance feel handling etc  very unhappy with hidden maintenance i expressed early concerns about this and all is not what it seems k miles on vehicle atm  services a  b  with discount coupons need pads  rotors   tires cant rotate uses dif size on front and back  each for a total of  when i said this is a bit much to service manager for a k car was told its normal maintenance that adds minimum of k to cost of vehicle over a  yr period thats insane  when i said that the tires are warrantied for k miles or  months was told not against wear and tear only defects beware buyer get it in writing
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,problems so my fiance got a c had  miles when we met but noticed a weird noise so took it to dealer and they replaced power steering assembly and that was at  miles then at  miles idler pulley was replaced and sunroof needed reprogramming then now at ish miles annoying rattling noise started to appear this is a fun car but not really reliable vehicle i cannot imagine drivng this vehicle without a warranty
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,squeak rattle and buzz squeaks rattles and buzzes like a  yr old blazer surprisingly poor build quality and blatant cheapness in materials at idle the fuel pump rattles and thumps so bad it makes the car sound like a diesel not like the old school mbz
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,benznomore keep in mind that my c   has only  kms is driven lightly and garage keptyettime to move away from benz once and for allto dateboth electric side mirrors replaced  each both gas tank pumps replaced a couple of times fuel gauge still goes out once ina while side mirror full of water looks like fish tank tire blown sidewall amongst others and just today car would not start leaving all scratching headsnot to mention benzs outrageous cost of ongoing service each annual visit
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,worst mercedes i have owned terrible gas mileage uncomfortable seats  no cushioning horrible wind noise when driving above  mph lowend speakers muddy sound
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,c not worth it at k needed a transfer case at k needed a drive shaft  just got my car back from the drive shaft repair and now coolant level warning light came on and a new grinding sound is coming from underneath the car  my warranty is over august  and mercedes will not extend the warranty  im so disappointed im going back to lexus  i had  japanese cars before the c i put k on each of them and between both of them i had to replace only  alternator  the alternator was replaced at k  shame on mercedes for not offering to extent the warranty and stand behind their car  shame on mercedes for putting a car on the road with such inferior parts  never again
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance, mercedes c sport matic i recently purchased a  cpo c sport
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,electrical gremlins mercedesbenz just bought back my  c because of untraceable electrical issuesi do accept that this was just luck of the draw a fluke the random lemon etc and dont believe that my car was indicative of the modeli would have random electrical issues like nonfunctioning buttons seat controls and warning lights that would magically correct themselves the next morningdealer and even mb regional tried to identify the problem but failed ultimately just buying back my carthat said the c was a blast to drive smoother more powerful and efficient than the c it replacedstill highly recommendedi replaced my car with a certified  c
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,somewhat disappointing i leased it  years ago and it was my first mb  initially it was a fun car to drive  with the kompressor engine i was zipping around and not spending a lot on gas  but as soon as it started to snow it was terrible  ive driven rearwheel drives in the snow before but the torque was too much and i was spinning all over the place  also the ac and heat is so weak thankfully i had the heated seats  im turning it in in  weeks and getting a c matic  also the dealer told me mb stopped making the c coupesi wonder why
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"dont bother after waiting over twenty years to buy my first benz  finally getting one was an underwhelming exercise in futility  this is a terrible car built like any other pinto gremlin or vega  honestly  bad build quality rattles squeaks loud when driving it alignment that cant be fixed a transmission that cant be diagnosed and a corporate office that refuses to deal with customers on any level whatsoever  i was told their director of customer assistance does not read or answer his mail nor will he contact any customers  this is mercedes benz  think twice if you are in the market for a benz"
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,what a car i usually trade cars every year but i
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"buy a japaneese car not mercedes i must admit this is by far the worst car i have ever bought i must add that the mercedesbenz customer service depertment in new jersey is not much better actually they need to call it cusatomer avoidance very poor attention to customer needs my engines top end head blew at about  miles after extensive research on my part i found mb knew anout the issue and sent no service bulletine to the field nor was a recall deployed to get these bad engines back my car has been in the shop for  days now and i still have no date at to getting it back my suggestion to a possible buyer of a c is to go buy a japaneese car i wish i had"

Mercedes-Benz,, c
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,run run run i have had my  c for about a   yrs and it was the worst purchase of my life i bought the vehicle with k miles so i knew it would need some tlc but i never thought it would need as much as it has  weeks after purchasing the alternator light came on i have that replaced for about  luckily i purchased an extended warranty and they covered half of the cost i live in indiana where the winters can be very cold and snowy rear wheel drive in the winter is not fun during the summer it drove great but as soon as the temps reached below  the car started having issues starting i would go out in the morning to start it and nothing completely dead i thought maybe it needed a new battery so i spent  on a new battery still had issues i am a single mother so i do not have time nor do i have the money to get this fixed this car has made me late to work with its starting issues multiple times thank god i will be trading this vehicle in soon i also had other issues fixed that cost me around  this might be a flashy car but not reliable i am done paying for premium gas and  oil changes if you have to extra cash to throw around on this car to fix its issues everyone other week then buy one but i have had nothing but problems the passenger seat also decided to stop working there is just too much electric powered everything and the battery can not keep up or it is just made poorly i will now be sticking with american made cars for the rest of my life thanks mercedesbenz for making a crap car and making me spend over  just to get to point a to point b
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,worst car ever i am  years old ive driven hundreds of cars and worked as a race car engineer and also worked at dealerships and never never in all that time have i come across a car with so many design faults and poor quality components the many forums tell the story bottom line is that mercedes tried to reinvent the wheel at every phase of the design in general but especially with the electrics the sam system is a joke the seat adjusting components another joke in fact any of the electrical systems not associated with the engine except the stupid oil level sensor instead of  dipstick are a joke i would love to meet the chief electronics design engineer of these vehiclesupdate they get worse with age mercedes should be forced to buy them all back rear view mirror fell to pieces dash display disappeared speedo and rpm gauges showed  rpm and  mph while sitting in traffic high beam stopped working window washer stopped working turn signals do not stay on hazard signal stopped working etc etc
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,a lovehate relationship the sway bar rods go regularly fortunately they go within a year so are covered under parts warranty fender liner fell off cv boots replaced heater door motor broke signal switch broke rear speakers rattled drivers seat belt squeaked rear set belts lock up at c passenger seat bottom loose rear door lock knobs come loose and the rod drops inside headlight bulbs are  each nothing serious mechanically though bit it is starting to rust at the same place on all  of the doors
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,disappointed just got rid of this after  years  soon after buying back of the passenger seat felloff then the engines serpentine belt felloff  left me wo power steering  in serious danger of overheating then the interior door handle of the driversside door broke off then the drivers cupholder broke  round logo inserts in center of wheels fell off  right driver armreststorage lid gets sticky  attracts a layer of grime  the interior door handles made of  malleable plastic discolor  become mismatched with the rest of the armrest assembly  scratches and looks terrible  then i discovered rust on all door bottoms  above the license plate then the ac dampers began to malfunction
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,worst nighmare please read bought the  mercedes ck sport sedan from dealership used with just over  miles had problems after two weeks and never quit engine dying chugging losing power  different times in less than a year all suspension replaced two rims bent rough ride severe right pulling sunroof broke rear defroster didnt work multiple check engine lights transmission stuck or thumped occasionally many sensors replaced and theres still more had the car less than a year and went from k miles and dozens of problems and thousands and thousands in repairs will never get a mercedes again if you are thinking of getting this car please dont do it i now have a toyota and couldnt be happier
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,stay away really ive never been more disappointed in the quality and value of a vehicle  initial purchase was used from a dealer  vehicle had k at the time  replaced door handles that literally broke off inside door panel  air conditioner had musty odor and has even after spending  still has odor  air ventilation baffle determines vents to blow from is broken and too expensive to repair  failures at k miles ignition coil   starter motor  transmission plug gasket  spark plugs  transmission mounts  motor mounts  not repaired yet control arms  not repaired yet  just spent  this month and about  more to go  stay away
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,seduced by the shining star my wife thinks this car is beautiful and loves it because of that i can only see the horrible reliability expensive purchase price and the crippling maintenance costs recently had an alternator go bad at k for a  surprise no power mushy ride cheap stereo where  of  speakers dont work  very high tco in both money and frustration even the salesman admitted the c line had major quality problems and offered to sell us a newer model no thanks
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,oh the electrical woes what a great car to look at fun to drive except when you have to get a loaner when the radio wont work or like the time there was a sparking wire making the drivers seat dangerous or the time the windshield wipers stopped working or the time the left headlamp would not light each time it was switched on or the time i had it in the shop when the right headlamp would not light when it switched on the whole component had to be rebuilt   other than that the car is a pleasure to drive  but since it is a glorified chrysler now expect it to be in the shop quite often to fix annoying problems  buy a benz see the world in a loaner car
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,"not worth the money its  car and not very disapointed for what you get for the money thinking about trading it for bmw"
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"mb  mostly broken been in shop  times in  months outof service about  days biggestcomplaint was occasional hesitancy inacceleration and rough idle took dealera year to fix they tried to convince meit was in spec various otherproblems mb has promised a tradeassist for a new car well see"
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"no more mercedes ive been pleased in general with my decision to purchase the c  i love how the car handles and the smoothness of the ride  i would not be a second time buyer with mercedes though  had a terrible experience with pete mankins mercedes in texarkana tx  complained more than once to mercedes benz corporation and have never received any response  always that independently owned phrase from mercedes benz customer service  never plan to purchase another mercedes product due to the treatment from the company  will stay with honda from now on  have owned  and will continue doing business with honda"
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,fun in a small package eventhough the car looks small on the
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,transmission speed sensor issue i was the nd owner of this  it had k on it when the transmission went out on me with no signs of something was wrong i have one year on it and it will be mines send the title i just spent  that i didnt have and my warranty of course ran out i had the car fixed and i have a used transmission with a  days warranty and i had it back within  days and i was going down a hill to stop at the light and my car shut off i pulled over and twist the key off it started back up with no hesitation but it has me nervous so im taking the car back to the mechanic i want to keep the car i dont want another car payment but im getting attempted to trade up and away from benz
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,what i got myself into need to know the vehicle in and out also have some mechanical knowledge or pay the price no resale value
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,outrageous maintenance costs my  mercedes benz c matic was the worst financial decision i have ever made and will never own another  the car has just under a miles and ive put over  in repairs a few days ago the check engine light came on so once again back to the dealership the called with a repair estimate for  really  i declined the repairs and will be buying a new car today i doubt if i will get much for trade in given the repair expenses   so its been an expensive car to own and no resale value  and it didnt even reach  miles
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,dont buy i cant believe nobody has mentioned the balance shaft gear failure this is very common issue in all mercedes benz cars that have the m engine in it this is a major issue that costs over k to replace and thats if your engine is not destroyed by the metal that goes through your engine as this gearsprocket fails do a little research and see for yourself there are multiple class action lawsuits regarding this matter and since  mb usa fails to accept responsibility and sticks its customers with this huge repair bill beware this issue starts with the p together with the p engine code with failure soon to follow also shame on edmunds for not listing such a well known issue
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,poor reliability initial impressions were good but then came the problems  heres a breakdown    cylinder head replaced due to valve going bad at get this  miles     left my wife stranded as the fuse box blew a circuit preventing the car from being started  this at just over  miles  had to get the car towed to dealership    left me stranded when the cam positioning sensor went bad at  miles  had to get the car towed to dealership    left me stranded again when the fuel pump went out a month later  had to get the car towed to dealership    found out during this repair i would need to replace both front rotors as they were worn down  at  miles
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,concern wtransfer case  future quality overall i like my c  i gave low quality rating bc of my transfer case issue after only  yrs pros handles well in the snow  mpg highway average looks expensive cons passenger head rest and rear view mirror rattles  to fix i have to keep head rest lowered when seat isnt in use and every so often have to adjust the mirror mile marker only does whole s so cant tell when gone  mile cd changer fills glove compartment at k miles the transfer case began making rubbing noise on tight turns  would have been  repair wo cpo warranty
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,disappointed in my first mb i had always wanted a mercedes and was very excited when we bought this car brand new last year unfortunately it hasnt been all that i had dreamed of  it is useless in snowice  last year i learned that lesson the hard way with  of snow our other three vehicles not mb were fine with that tiny bit of snow but not the mb  it also recently stopped dead in the middle of a busy road with me and my little boy in it  it has been at the dealership since last week and they cant get any error codes so they have no idea whats wrong with it i am very disappointed in this car and am thinking about selling it because i dont feel safe in it any longer  it only has  miles on it
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,ole reliable never let me down plan on  million miles
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance, years later still a good car we have never had the car in the shop for major problems just o sensors replaced a few times and a few other maintenance parts still drives well and has held up well k miles or so and you still take it on a  or  hour trip without worrying about anything bad happening to it
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance, mercedes c this car has had numerous problems that would not be expected from a car of this class from the time that i purchased it the windshield wiper motor has gone out  times costing  to replace the display screen for the temp control has been going in and out since ive had the car it was replaced with another one that did the same thing the dealerships repair shop could not find the problem the steering wheel is not properly aligned with the car problem could not be found once again there is in a water leak in the trunk that cannot be resolved after numerous trips back to the dealers service dept overall this car has been a big disappointment for the money
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,believe it virtually no problems with this car i purchased it used five years ago  brakes and battery had to be replaced right away but other than that routine maintenance is all she needed i once spilled juice down the gear shifter costs  to replace transmission control unit and gear shifter  that is the only problem ive had in five years at over k i hate to lay her to rest but shes lived her life and half of someone elses oh yeah just recently the wiper motor and ac blower went out shes probably dying goodbye bessie
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,has no value the  mercedesbenz c sedan requires high test fuel yet has no power to speak of  its gas milage stinks for such a small car  it is not very comfortable or roomy on the inside this car would have been an ok choice for a single person its resale and tradein values are terrible  if i would have done appropriate research beforehand and known all of these things i would have never of purchased this car  it is surprisingly bad for one of the alledged higher end vehicles
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,"poor electical sysyem two of the origional tires developed problems early on as the steel belts went out of allignment and the tire manufacturer refused to honor their warranty forcing the purchase of a complete set of new tiresno need to focus on the problems while the car was under warranty as mercedes handled those well afterwards the electronics in the dash went haywire and caused some problems under the hoodtotal cost to repair both was almost  when i marveled that the dealership had these unusual parts in stock i was told that this problem has become very common causing mercedes to stock their dealerships with these parts for prompt repairs"
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,you pay for quality not just the name cant get over how well thought out
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,mercedes c in four years had to tow this car twice
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,unreliable with serious quality problems after  miles started to show a list of serious and costing problems in less than  months  may to july  needed to change the abs control unit  repair more than  had an electrical pane due to water infiltration from the rood drainage to the electrical harness  towing plus  in repairs   is a nice car to drive but you do not know when it will be the next problem in  months i spent in repairs which is  of the current sales price  k miles very poor resale value
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,terrible windshield wipers the  mercedes benz c luxury is nice to look at you can get many options at a costbut the windshield wipers stutter and are very noisy the auto wiper sensor is terrible and has no consistency its hard to believe mercedes has made such a huge mistakethis problem destroys the whole car
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,lovehate this car i bought the car in  with k miles on it for   i traded in my  cadillac deville for what i called my german experiment  the  c has some very nice features  it handles well on the highway and the engine is bulletproof   there are so many little things that have gone wrong  the power seat controls the air damper that controls the ventfloor air the rear window shade a  gas pump the cd player and more   the singlemost bothersome problem is the paint  soon after i purchased the car i noticed very small rust bubbles on the door panels and front and rear fenders  over time they have grown to be large rust spots the size of silver dollars and larger   what a disappointment  these are certainly not the mercedes benz of the s and s  i recently went back to a cadillac and will probably never purchase a mercedes again  this german experiment has failed
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,worst car ever  i bought this car with only one previous owner with only k miles cash for k worst mistake ever as soon as i got the car things started breaking down transmission electrical etc if you are looking for a luxury vehicle stay away
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,frequent expensive repairs this model car has numerous problemsmy  yr old wife drives this car gently yet after k miles i have replaced braking computer rear brakes x front brakes x alternator numerous sensors spark plugs and wires x maf x egr valve x egr tube fuel pump motor mounts x rear coil springs numerous bulbs window regulators x front speakers door handle battery x wheel keys x front control arm steering assembly gas cap and sway bar linksyet to repair fading lcd instrument display pass seat heater front shocks cracked cigarette tray cover shifter base pulled away from console steering wheel valve cover gaskets clicking noise in drive shaft trunk handle
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,does not meet expectations about  months ago i picked up my first mb a  c one owner  miles garagekept and appeared well cared for i am greatly disappointed in the paint the paint easily chips exposes the metal below and begins to spider out with blistering rust underneath the surrounding paint if left unchecked the car will be a mess in less than a year it reminds me of the  amc gremlin my father purchased for less than k  the paint job was horrible and did not last a year never in my wildest dreams did i think that paint would be a problem with this car  i have stuck to american cars until this one and i am sorry i did not purchase another cadillac or a buick  i miss my cadillac
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,worst purchase ever the car looks great on the inside  outside but other than that its the worst purchase ever  ive never had so many issues from a car than this one  this was my first  last mb purchase the issues ive had taillights constantly go out seats dont move anymore acheather no longer work belts broke catalytic converter the list goes on
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,a lemon with a good engine the car was good when it was new then everything started to good bad audio system went bad several times transmission went bad sun roof malfunctions paint faded badly side moulding turns from black to tan ess went bad brakes vibrate a lot the dealer was not able to fix this yet for the past  years gas mileage is way less than what was advertised lots of noise on bumpy roads engine is loud speaker went bad several times heating is slow vent solenoid went bad several times costing almost  for each visit cd changer went bad twice turn signal bulb blows out too frequently cup holder gets stuck more room is needed electronic diagnosis need to be more accurate cost me money
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,very disappointed in the four years we have owned this vehicle reliability has been a major concern  blinker bulbs have been replaced  times  the power seat became inoperative weve had intermittent problems with sun roof and back window shade opening and closing properly  power steering fluid leaked from the car  air conditioning system failed to cool after  years and the dealer originally could not find leak  six months later the same problem arose the leak was found and the repair cost   alternator recently failed while driving at highway speeds the car stalled almost causing a major traffic accident  cost to repair   the gas pedal is nonresponsive when starting off from zero miles per hour
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,disappointed this vehicle has been nothing but

Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,"poor quality workmanship for an expensive car i bought this car brand new at  km the interior quality wears out very quickly it is made of poor quality materials the leather seats are poorly sewn and has ripped on me after  years of usage my car stereo has had problems sometimes it turns on other times it doesnt even turn on it is very randomly as to when it works most of the issues i have been encountering has been right after the warranty expiration of  years i have had older cars made by honda and acura that have lasted longer and have kept their quality i would not recommend a mercedez benz if you are looking for a luxury high end it is not worth the price"
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,drives much worse than its looks i bought  c certified by dealer with k miles after few days i noticed the power steering noise which is driving me crazy unless i turn the radio on to drown the noise the car has no power at all after traffic stop you can see every type of car passing by when i take my foot off the gas it feels as if someone has pressed the brakes i took it back to the dealer who told me this is normal i complained about the noise from the engine when it starts the sound of metal pinging and the power steering noise the dealer kept the car for five days after which they told me this is normal if this is normal then shame on you mb this is not what i expected unfortunately t
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,sorry caddy and lincoln k mile update trouble in paradise the local dealer performed the k mile service which included the replacement of many filters and fluids but i had to go back at a later date for the required transmission service after spending a total of  for both services the service adviser tells me the matic transfer case is leaking and worse yetit is a common problem on all mbs with all wheel drive fortunately warrantee covered what could have been a very expensive repair this is the first problem of any sort with the car
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,worst car ever purchased this car new in march c sport matic nonnavi must admit i did not do my research before buying and purchased the car because i have always wanted a new mercedeswhat a mistakecar looks awesome sitting stillvery well builtwhat is wrong the turn signal is about  inches lower than any other carcruise control stalk is where the turn signal stalk should bealso you cant see the wiper control without stuffing your head underbehind the steering wheel to take a look the radio controls are uselessthere is a cool dial on the center console but it sucks different ways to change the radio station and if the stupid looking visor
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,be carefull purchased in dec was finally delivered feb but not as specified no hk stereo no ipod interface no spoke rims dealer automotriz stuttgart refuses any adjustment after only  miles the paint had flaked off the hood medallion seats are horribly wrinkled bluetooth faulty stereo  system so distorted it is unusable besides missing a speaker worst is performance takes a full  seconds after accelerator is fully depressed to get any reaction from the engine when purchasing make sure you take your c class out for an extensive test drive and qc check before signing as many mb dealers are famous to send their customers to hell after taking your money buyer beware
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,should have kept my chrysler c hemi only one day into my new car and i am not pleased the c really lacks in comfort and room if your claustrophobic this is not the car for you the seats are small and uncomfortable programming your settings is a choir i have  years on this lease and i am counting the days purchased this mb instead of another  chrysler c v hemi because of chryslers financial state personally as far as comfort goes maybe in time i will feel different about this mb but why do i doubt that should have had a v
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,amazing car but horrible rims and tires i love the way this car drives but the quality of the wheels and tires are something you would expect from a yugo as ive had to replace  rims and  tires in  years the car drives like a beast and i love driving it every day the interior is comportable with high quality materials though their entertainment technology could use some updating the worst thing about this car by far is the quality of the wheels and tires i have owned this car two two years and it has been in the shop every  weeks of less because one of the rims has cracked or one of the tired has gone bad or had a blow out these rims are  a piece so why in the world they crack from normal driving not hitting pot holes or doing anything even slightly rough is absolutely insane on a regular basis i get in the car in the morning to find the tire pressure light on and have to take it back to the dealership to get it fixed  the only saving grace is that i have the wheel and tire insureance on the car but will probably sell the car when that expires because the cost just wont be worth it when the rims dont crack then the run flat ties keep getting bubbles which cause them to go flat or even worse blow out the side wall when you are driving again for  a tires i would think they would last longer than  months before having to get replaced again the worst part is that mercedes has known about this problem for years since it happens on all their c and e class cars yet they dont fix it i love the car but this problem is going to drive me to find a different brand when the warranty expires on this one

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,c zoom
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,amazing car this car has  miles on it  you would never know it to look at it or drive it  it is so quiet that when you stand outside it and the engine is running you cant tell  almost all of themiles are hiway miles as i used it heavily for business travel  i got over mpg on the highway  the car doesnt even have a door ding on it  i bought an extended bumper to bumper warranty for mo which lasts as long as i continue to pay the fee and it is transferable  the interior is as clean as the exterior  the performance is beyond believe  the rate at which it accelerates can get you out of dangerous traffic situations on the freeway or anywhere else  it has a hookup for an ipod has bluetooth and plenty of room  im  and can drive it with my legs fully extended  it will make a uturn in the smallest radius ive ever seen on any street without having to use reverse  its been judiciously maintained no accidents and no major repairs  i have only put michelin tires bought at a mercedes dealership on the car  with the offset build of the suspension meaning the rear tires are one inch wider than the front tires and awd i have driven this car through three nasty blizzards and never lost my footing even when cars around me were spinning into the ditch  this is one great car
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,beware  the car dealership advisors are all paid by commission  they are competing to change things on your car whether its broken or not  im a woman and had the windshield wipers replaced without my authority at the first service after purchase  ive had them scare me that i needed brake jobs right away where i waited a year and it was still fine after checked out by other source  i bought my car brand new with warranty for  years as soon as the  years passed everything started breaking down from the seat belt safety light  some srs light with other minor malfunctions  check engine light  light bulbs and batteries are normal stuff and i wont complain about that  finally now i went shopping before work and came back to find i could not start my car due to ignition switch the care died had to be towed and service advisor tells me its a proprietary part which is true  verified by another trusted source and needs to be ordered and put in by mercedes           in the first  years of ownership the interior began looking horrible  the interior sliver stripping around the water holders all came out just because i used it  the radio button black coating with the  on it started stripping and peeled away  black and ripped white spots all over like an old car  i was told by the service manager its caused by lotion on your hands  the car seats are uncomfortable no matter how you adjust it  not good for a very tall or heavy person   think twice if you purchase this vehicle parts are all electrical and expensive labor its not like getting a toyota or honda fixed after warranty runs out
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,do not buy c i have been having this car for three years now  the worst of this car is that the bumper is too low and eventually you need to get repair for the bumper the rims are aluminum and they keep breaking down and i change tires so many times   i dont recommend this car
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,mbna corp has no regard for customers out of warranty i was happy my c sport matic while it was under warrantya few technical problems mostly wnavi but otherwise goodrecently at  miles and  months old my inside door handle broke making it impossible to exit the carit is  to repair this plastic part must replace entire pannel the dealer said it was out of warranty and suggested calling mbna corporateboth the agent assigend to my case and his supervisor were rude and could not care less that this would have been covered  days earlier or that it was my familys th benzi told him i would never buy another  he didnt careat least the dealer agreed to split the repair costnext time porsche
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,i hate my c quality i bought a mercedes c brand new in  hoping that buying a new car would save me any car trouble unfortunately i returned the next day to the dealer ship with a fuel engine issue the car stayed over night to get some engine part replaced a month later i had break lights turn on due to corrosion another issue was a delay with car taking off as i would press down on the accelerator the rpm would shoot up but the car wouldnt go i took the car several times the first year the dealer ship wasnt able to fix a few things until i escalated the issue to the dealer ship manager at beshoff in san josei have taken in my car over  times due to repeating problems bmw quality is much better
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,i paid for the emblem my  c is stunning to look at and has a smooth ride however some design features are stupid examples dual climate control cannot be controlled using drivers knob you have to turn both there is no trunk pass through or fold down seats the ipod integration stinks  almost impossible to use actually the entire sound system is difficult to use radio presets must be accessed through the steering controls instead of the console joystick drivers view of the windshield wiper controls are obstructed by the steering wheel turn signal and cruise control stalks are in weird positions engine needs more power and not very responsive when you punch it beautiful car but needs improvement
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,brass tacks having owned the c for a year now i wanted to review it based on the experiences i have had  first of all i want to list all the good things about this car  the exterior is perfect in every way  the interior with the exception of the cruise control lever is designed very well  i do enjoy the fact that everything has worked like a charm without one problemwell done  now for the bad  the seats are downright uncomfortable in every way  too hard and cramped  the steering is just plain boring and unattached to the road  the car is just not fun to drive  i feel i should just buy a honda next time and forget it if i want reliable and boring  a good car but not what i expect
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,got their mojo back last mercedes was a e awful switched to saabs and then two bmw s and finally a bmw  x cabin too small on the bmw  and the run flat tires are awful  the c sport  matic dont laugh  performs like  the  series only more nimble plenty of power and stability interior is a little austere and the trunk is just too small close call over the audi  but on balance a more solid feel without those silly led headlights
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,bad mistake bought this car as a present for my wife just because she wanted it this car is pathetic in comparison to my bmw even the corolla i owned previously was better  engine computer module keeps on failing  even the loaner they gave me felt flimsy as if it was about to fall apart
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,over rated i purchased the c sport coupe to replace a  mitsu eclipse big mistake  the benz has a pretty face but is a dog to drive with a slow shifting transmission and poor corneringthe funtodrive factor is on a par with an inexpensive japanese or korean car  quality is a concern also with problems with the srs system alignment rattles etc  last week i cut my losses and traded for a  honda s which is getting about the same mileage with the car being overrated and overpriced i wouldnt recommend a benz to anyone at this point
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,c broken sunroof within  days of purchase unable to close car received with difficulty opening cup rack in consol brought in for repair but not fixed  very unstable cup rack broken latches on console in  months of use prohibiting use of storage boxes  brake drum rust in  months looks awful but im told by dealership is normal   cannot move in slightest bit of snow as well as sliding into oncoming traffic in the highway intersection when stopped on incline i was put in a very frightening situation and personally having the ability to drive every type of vehicle i must state the cars performance with any unstable surface  is very poor   i am presently looking at a tradein
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,you need this there is absolutly nothing that you
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,nothing but problems since we purchased our cclass its been a horrible experience engine had tapping noise since day one dealership said that knocking  tapping noise is normal it leaks like crazy you can smell oil buring in the car we have replaced the rear main seal  valve cover gaskets  and now the transfer case has to be replaced  still smells and leaks we came from acura to mb because i have owned several older mbs and loved them but we wanted a new one the dealership is the worst chevrolet dealership disguised as a mb dealership the car is total junk never own another one going to back to acura
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,maintenance queen had car since it was new mercedes c kompressordont get me wrong the car is beautiful and is a jet when it comes to ride and handling but thats not what we use it forthe car is a daily to work and back car and every now and then a road trip maybe one state overit seems like every week there is some expensive service that needs to be done on itthe car eats tires due to a poor suspension geometry and you have to change the brakes every k miles it seems likethe car leaks oil and constantly showing error messagesi pride myself at maintaining my cars but i cant seem to stay on top with this onegetting rid of it as soon as possiblek on it now
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,saves me money in gasoline and repairs  miles in one year  hiway driving average  to mpg between oil changes
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,buy stock in a tire company my  mb c kompressor so far has been a pretty big disappointment  it only has k on it and ive already had to buy three  sets of tires  it chews them up like cheap candy  the dealer has done  alignments already and multiple tire balances  the road noise is horrific after only a few thousand miles on each new set  the dealer has not been helpful  i try to drive as conservatively as possible but it still chews the tires up  im considering going back to a bmw  the mb is a nice car but i cant afford to keep buying tires like this  my dealer has been zero help  mb has not returned my calls or letters  guess its time for an attorney  buyer beware
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,wouldnt buy another mb i have had the ck since  and there have been problems non stop brakes squealing all the time replaced twice there is very ittle gas pedal room handles not even close to an audi or bmw horrible traction in a little snow or rain loud engine noise the only things great about this car are the gas mileage and style customer service is very poor and watch out for the salesmen on telling you that this car is fully covered that standard option end in  now you have to pay for this bumper to bumper option things changed for the worse after the merger with chrysler bottom line last mb i will ever recommend or buy
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,expensive to own i bought this car with  miles on it and it now has   i have spent  in repairs and am advised by a reputable local shop that it needs  more but that does not include the odd windshield wiper motor that threatens to go out periodically or the power seat controls that only work half the time not the half at the shop where they commonly intone unless its not working when we look at it we cant tell whats wrong with it  handles well and gets decent mileage  builtin analog cell phone only works half the time  next car will be a hondatoyota
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,watch out  i am sorry to say this is my first and last mercedes just a month ago new transmission under warranty now compressor on ac went i have spent a lot more on maintenance than on my  hondas sad thing is i still owe  on this mercedes needs to go back to the drawing board mine has  miles on it my nephews  accord with  everything still works his car like it rolled off the showroom floor
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,saved my life distracted and going  on a lane road the front tire hit the gravel shoulder i was spun around across the road and into the ditch on the other side i could feel the car working to stabilize itself and my thought at the time was thank goodness im in this vehicle i should not be here today despite the severity of the spinout the car survived without any problem  i was amazed i got back up on the road slowly got to my interstate onramp slowly accelerated up to  and went on my way  had it checked at my destination and there was absolutely nothing wrong  amazing
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,is there anything bad i received my first mercedes upon turning  it was a handmedown e with kbut i was hooked on benz from then onbefore starting college my parents surprised me with a  cit had just over k so it was just getting started after having for almost  yearsand k miles i still love it mercedes has outdone themselves the horsepower seemed a little small until you drive the car it is fast it really seems to have everything a car could need besides a couple small quirks broken cupholdersurprise and failed wiper motor i have had no problemsservices are a little pricey but people who complain about that had to have known that beforehand good gas mileage too way to go mb
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,far from fahrvergngen i bought this car used  years ago  in the time i have had it i have had to replace the windshield wiper motor  times  i have had to replace the planetary sun gear  the sensor on the braking system failed and resulted in above average repair cost  the basasr system failed  the cost of this car has outweighed any pleasure that the turbo design and features could have offered  it has put me off german cars altogether  im going back to japanese
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,"baby benz i bought the car with  miles and have put about  miles on it since  it feels like it is glued to the ground  for all of you mb owners you know what i am referring to  the biggest surprise has been its fuel consumption or lack there of  i find myself filling up about every  days which is a vast improvement from how often i have to take my ml to the pump"

Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,headache i bought this car brand new back in  and im compelled to write a review because this carmercedes only caused me headaches and hole in my pocket even though i took care of this car it has a lot of problems i remembered in the second yearstill covered by warranty i had to fix the sunroof twice then from there on cd broke lots of things broke the quality is very bad the cost to maintain this car was at least  a year i still have this car till today and recently the fuel pump gave up the steering wheel wouldnt lock door handles broken etc my other carprius never gave me problems and very cheap to maintain as for me i dont think im buying a mercedes again
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,lemon of all lemons results may vary nd owner of a  ck built in bremen germany make sure you have a fat wallet if you plan on owning a used ck i have had nothing but problems with this car with only k on it i have had to get the transmission serviced twice once at k and now at k due to it going into safe mode bad sensors leaking orings for transmission harness  also have had  an intermittent misfire in cylinder   had to replace fuel pump coils plugs fuel lines throttle body cleaning still does it from time to time rough idle randomly had it at an independent shop for  months and they were even stumped by it seriously if you are not making k a year or live at home with your parents forget the image of the mercedes and go with the toyota or honda

Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,quality and serviceor lack of car was not prpared properly and pulled to the right dealer said he could not repair the alignment unless the customer complained several item such as the automatic tempeature control not workingit was not calibrated at the factory  the automatic transmission leaked because a gasket was used that was not compatble with the fluit the proper gasket was of a different color and the situation could have been corrected while the car was in for service  mbusa told me that they do not repair it until it actually leaks  remember we have a situstion here where we know it will leak it is only a question of when for a company like mercedes this shure is a lousy attitude next car bmw
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,the ultimate lemon  i got involved in the worst car of my life i didnt realize that the car was as small as it really is the kid keeps kicking the back of the front seat mileage could be better but the worst thing is the car at g miles the tranny went poof gone at g the tranny went again then a dozen other things kept breaking then to drive the nail home the engine started burning oil i clocked the car burning oil at one qt per  miles the dealership in greenwich basically said lets keep a eye on it ya  lets keep a eye on it  i called mercedes headquarters and lodged my complaint they are keeping a eye on it also next stop is the lawyer maybe he can keep a eye on it
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,not bad entry level luxury car this isnt a bad little car  like others have mentioned it is not comfortable for the long haul  seats are very firm up front and the kids complain about being cramped in the rear  the hesitation from stop is scary  have almost been creamed a few times because of the hesitation  those issues asidefuel mileage is in the upper s on the highway high teens in the city its much quieter than our old car a  honda accord  this isnt a bad car just some quirks
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,"disappointed buyer beware of this piece of crap the car has had nothing but problems   kms and it has been into dealer  times now they have had it for two weeks so far st they replaced the fuel injectors now the kompressor wrong kompressor installed by factory  really makes you wonder  still not fixed maybe the dealer is incompetent no loner offered i would really think twice before buying another mercedes a real lemon high end junk"

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,dream car nothing can beat a benz
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,back to the benz this is my second mercedes and after
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,emergency brake does not release emergency brake did not release when engaged the first time i used it on my   c the dealership told me that  it has that problem when it is freezing cold i have never experienced that problem on any of a half dozen different brands of cars i have driven in my life
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,motor blew after  miles my motor blew after  miles heck of a time getting dealer service nav is impossible to use interior can be really loud would not buy again
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,very dissapointing nice car to drive terrible car to operate nav and entertainment system is old technologysmall screen and tedious to operate must have the radio on to get backup camera back up camera points downward and wording on screen blocks view clump of levers on left side of steering wheel and nothing on right side usb port at bottom of console compartment temperature controls too far down in center stack door lock knob protrudes too far up hit funny bone too many times at drive through window terrible foot room in back seat humming noise after shutting off engine lag in engine during initial acceleration on high speed wipers dont move fast enough to get rid of heavy rain car chews up shoulders on front tires imitation leather is actually nice last mercedes ill ever leasebuy
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,great car but horrible nav system nav system is impossible to use period
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,wasted a lot of money i have had nothing but problems from this car every other month something else breaks this car was a certified preowned during the very first month i owned this car it was in the shop for two weeks with mechanical problems the problems have ranged from different censors going bad to brakes wearing out way too soon and even the middle air vents breaking twice
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"very disappoited im very disappointed of the quality of the car and the dealer service the dealer has been incompetent in fixing the noisy problem when the wheels are being turned for  times over month period how much more headache do i have to endure who hired all those skilled mechanics lexus i bet"

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,drive to arrive
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,review has hard ride and hard seats
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,what a buy shop around for a pristine low mileage mercedes they are out there you will not be disappointed once you find it use carfax to insure that there have been no accidents possible structural damage and preferably only one owner also used mercedes all seem to have only one key and no manuals not sure if they are good to eat or if the previous owners want to keep a trophy manuals can sometimes be found on ebay and purchasing a second key is expensive
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance, yrs of ownership expensive maintenance  c air mass meter  floaty ride i need sport shocks  many features that are standard on less expensive car are not standard  ie cd intermittent wiper tsc etc  interior build qualitymaterial is very good everything is still tight after yrs  currently experiencing little foul play in suspension steering wheel is little shaky at speed  good fuel economy but requires premium grade i tried regular and noticed right away that the car didnt like it  torque available only after k rpm  dont like the single wiper and wiper blade is expensive to replace  transmission is very slow to respond  lack of side airbags
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,"definitely not a performance car but what do you expect from a weak engine in a benz car has been pretty reliable except the transmission failed once sturdy construction got hit by a truck on drivers side and got scratched and dinged but no real damage"
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior, and comfort nightmare  bought last year with  miles
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,"it should have been better had a few minor defects at the beginning but the real problem has been long term reliability  left me stranded twice between  and  milesonce for a failed air mass sensor and intake flapper valve and second for a bad fuel pressure regulator"
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,poor visibility poor acceleration the cpillar rear is a big honker  which makes changing lanes and backing out of the driveway unsafe no technology for showing cars in the blind spot acceleration is turbolagged ugh rear view camera lousy sound system great though
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,c tires i own a c  and over the last  months  i have had to replace  tires  rims and the front axles  thank god for the tire warranty  i think theyre made of jello  its complete ridiculous  ive tried to get them to give me a different brand but they wont  im really inconvenient to have to go to the service constantly but at least ive always got brand new tires  wtf  i assume its because it so heavy
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value, mb cclass use us news and world search under used cars for reliability safety cost etc
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,c is now a performance car pro as you expect from a mercedes they have designed a performance and yet comfortable luxury which positioned the car on par or slightly above the competition           cons the car has a default setting for a comfort mode and this cannot be changed unfortunately this means that we have to live with the auto engine off function which for some people can be very annoying if you want to change that feature you will need to switch the   button every time you restart the engine
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,amazingly fast but amazingly expensive to maintain in short purchased fall  as  model c with some upgrades burmeister led but no advanced assistance one recall steering one issue with radio reboots every  hours one door handle light died one rear bumper replaced due to discoloration  two services  k miles and k miles k miles a bit expensive but within limits  k miles service outrageously expensive  front tires are pretty much gone after k miles rear tires look like new mean dealer  implying i painted bumper myself and this is why it changed color worst experience of my lifeoverall  the car is surprisingly reliable but my mercedes dealer sucks will have to drive to orlando for future service update mercedes is still as reliable and as much fun as it was at k miles  minor warranty repairs  back pockets in front seats loose supercapacitor that handles stopandgo failed  entertainment system touch pad works randomly service unable to fix or even to admit this issue exists squeaks and rattles from navigation screen stop and go systems doesnt stop the engine anymore will get this fixed at next service still very satisifed with the car
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value, out of  months in the shop my car was rear ended parts had to come from germany   months and one more to repair the car  ordered every option  of them  the ventilated leather seats are horrible  the leather is worse than an honda accord the distronic plus works only on occasion  radio stop working and  months later finally getting another one  mileage at  mph an amazing  miles per gallon  ive had  recalls   pressure gauges replaced run flat tires are horrible  in talks with mbusa on lemon law  i traded a  c with every option and  miles for this one worse mistake everupdate i have had to hire a law firm the car has been in service now  days its going in again for electronics problems im fighting mb on the lemon law they offered  off of any new car i wanted of theirs and thats it the lemon law is  days and they have to return the full amount i will never own another mb product as long as i live i hate their product i changed from using helms bros in bayside ny to ralleye motors in roslyn  both places are awful i took my car into ralleye because my rear sensors were not working right they said the car was in an accident and needed  worth of parts to repair the problem i called the collision place who said bring the car in i did and  days later it was perfect and has been  centain cell phones have a software problem with the bermeister radio now in the mb the cell phone will make the radio and gps inoperative you have to turn off the phone to recycle it when i went to ralleye with the problem they chased me out i then went to the service manger doug and he said because i did not allow them to repair the car the last time i was not welcome there i asked him would you spend   on the repair if it was still under warrenty and he said no i then asked why i cant come in and he said i dont want you here ralleye is so large that they feel they are like god i would never recomend them to anyone again ever they are awful oh one more thing they charge  per hour to work on your car if its out of warranty
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,mercedes c  worst car of the year it is in fact an absolute joke dont buy it or lease it because the drivers seat is so badly designed that you are going to end up in the hospital the front interior of the car is totally unacceptable theres nowhere to put the cell phone youve got to be a rocket scientist to put the ac on and off the car also stalls and you cant start it again also the power steering randomly freezes with no warning and you are stuck until it decides to work again i have driven all the cars in my life and this car should have never been on the market there is not much difference with the  c dont buy it the mercedes c is the worst car of the year tony
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,biggest pile of crap i have owned had the car coming up on  year i have  miles the st week i owned the car driving mph down the expressway the power steering went out the car had to be towed to the mb dealer a month later the sunroof would not close it started to rain again back to the dealer  months in the sunroof broke again this time i told the dealer last straw fix this thing or take the car back tomorrow i take it in again for a knocking sound when you turn also the sunroof is now once again broke previous i had a e and had no problems this  c has been a huge disappointment for the money mb commands this is just unacceptable

Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,worst car i owned this is the worst car i drove in  years at first when i drove it with the dealer sales rep i was impressed of the technology ie navigation attention assist lane assist etc perhaps the salesman was very convincing that i did not pay attention to other important factors i have to consider before closing the deal it was too late for me to realize that the car i got did not have a spare tire but instead a runflat tire the runflat tire is a small tire compared to a spare tire this means that if i got a flat tire and used the runflat tire i cannot drive normally as the tires will not be balanced and i will be prone to accident if i travel for a long distance and in case i got accident because of this runflat tire i will file a lawsuit for a manufacturers defects this gle  was manufactured without taking into consideration that a car should always be driven with all four tires of same size at all times

Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,how can they build at this level i traded in my car this weekend i had owned a  s matic for  years in that time it was trouble free for  periods of  months traded it in with k which was limited due to the multiple issues that we encountered first the tire pressure sensors went times next the turn signal control stick disintegrated next the heated steering wheel control had the same issues the washer fluid reservoir cracked i went through a  dozen bulbs and each time a bulb goes out it disables the electrical system the ultimate issue was the continued shaking when the car went over  mph apparently there is a known issue with the struts but mb will not own up to it i almost forgot to include the ac unit working on and off usually in the winter never again

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,mercedes nothing but the worst you better do your long hard and unbiased researched on this vehicle because if you do not you will be presented with a host of surprises that can and will financially burry and emotionally burden you this vehicle is not worth owning outside of warranty and if you are thinking about buying one for a few thousand dollars because it is cheap you better know how to work on it or have a mechanic who has no bills regardless you will paya lot this vehicle is an absolute money pit it is extremely unreliable the abc pump accumulators struts body control system are flawed and can and will drain your savings account the transmission is one of the worst mercedes has ever put out it is extremely unreliable it will either need to be replaced or overhauled the conductor plate goes bad the speed sensor goes bad the crankshaft position sensor goes bad which will cause the car to not start or stall while driving the ac blower motor and resistor go bad which results in no ac the rain sensor goes bad the interior temperature sensor goes bad which is located near the rear view mirror and will cause the climate control system to not work the radio controls may exhibit delayed input the transmission and motor mounts go bad very quickly even with moderate driving radiator longevity is low passenger sensors in seats fail and cause the srs light to come in which causes the pre safe unavailable message to appear in the dash gear shifter selector bushings go bad softclose doors fail this car is just an absolute disaster

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,"second s class  th mbz i think that mbz put too many bells and whistles on this car i am paranoid about having any kind of a fender bender as the electronics will surely be messed upi had to have new breaks and rotors put on at less than  miles the climate control makes a weird noise sometimes noise comes from engine and per the dealership it is normal car is built to be quiet and then there is a weird alien soundvoice control has improved but still not perfect sadly siri works better in responding to text messages etcmassage on the seats is silly along with the embracing seatsi have never used the perfume dispenser"
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,worst car i have ever owned purchase the car in august  with all the bells and whistles barely drove it was in the shop every  miles  problems with computer direct injection  too many distractions hard to work heatac the cameras are distracting on the dash mercedes is buying the car back because it constantly breaks down and leaves me on the road  k miles on the car in  months and i drove mostly a loaner car not even sure i have a lux car ive been driving a loaner car was in the shop for a month got it back and it broke down the next day mercedes hasnt even offered a loaner this time totally unreliable if you look on this site you see dozens of them turned in with less than k miles
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,if you dont know what to d with  buy a mb sit in the car at least two hour and try  every thing

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,its not that bad if youre previous car was a range rover trust me when i say all european luxury suvs have these kinds of issuesmy previous car was a range rover hse and a v tuareg before thatboth had multiple air suspension issues engine oil leaks sensor failures steering column replacements etcfriends with xs dont fair well eithermy rr even needed a drive shaft replacementfact of life unfortunately if you want the luxury and style of the euro suvs the price you pay is well beyond the window stickerthe key is to enjoying the vehicle is pick the brand with a nearby dealership that treats you well and expect to spend your free time there  i tried the lexus route for a year just too bland and predictable
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,let it ride this is a truck of excess all options basically included and its a pleasure to drive also stands out against the gl  so just get this truck and let it ride
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,towing beast embarrasses many pick up trucks absolute serenity   bought used one year ago at  km  miles towed a  ft lbs travel trailer for long distances alberta to british columbia absolute towing beast gobs of torque the smoothest auto ever very smart when trailering towed the same trailer with a  v gmc truck and it sucked reved it up all the time to keep pace fuel economy was horrible this one just sits at  rpm  at worst when going o steep uphils fuel economy is the same as a sequoia empty when towing better than a sedan when empty  kms on a tank frequently  miles quality all around comfort is supreme built like a tank problemshid light rear electric hatch lock replaced turbo oil leak
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,gllemon owned gl for  years nothing but problemsvery cheaply built cheap and nasty components and plastic eg some sort of plastic covering film started piling off the steering wheel controlsfake wood trimmings face leather etclater on idiscovered that it has common base and components with jeepmercedes customer service is famously the worst watch the top gear and in deed it is
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,check your sanity before you buy had car for  years numerous issuesfailing suspension rear hatch electronics etc nice car when its running im convinced they are lemons from the start now at km steering rack needs to be replaced mercedes staff see you as a money bag no help would not stand for their product mercedes should be ashamed of building such a poor quality product in order to preserve my sanity moving to lexus boring is goooood
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,worst car i ever owned this car could be great if only it wasnt constantly returning to the dealer on the back of a tow truck   we bought it new and within  months the front engine gasket blew out  two months later the same thing happened but this time the leaking oil caused a serpentine belt failure and we lost the steering  not good when driving down the road in a ton suv  a few months later the power steering pump failed  today we discovered oil all over the garage floor  absolutely unacceptable reliability as soon as the mercedes dealer patches the thing back together it will be off to the bmw dealer to trade it in
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,mercedes gl  cdi i bought the  mb gl cdi used with k miles on it  i have k on it now  i bought  blizzak snow tires for it and it makes it go through any conditions like a tank  i had the air suspension replaced under warranty by mb  no other problems  on a ski trip to vermont one night got down to  degrees  failed to start without putting in a bottle of  diesel fuel treatment  started right up after that with no more problems what a ride  adults  kids loaded to the hilt with a roof rack and still got  miles per gallon
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,overpaid underachieved dont buy i purchased my gl  with  miles in may during the  months it was in the shop  times for repairs i had the following items fixed or repaired dvd parktronic sensors new struts mystery oil lights battery computer upgrades air temp sensor hatch corrected would not come out of gear sideview mirror pivet replaced and this is only part of the listi called mb to file a complaint for buy back or compensation with no luckseveral attorneys said they will not deal with mb because they dont recognize they make lemons we took a loss to get out of this car and avoid lawsuit btw maintenance is  and tires are  tires last  miles look around at other cars before buying
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,oil leak causes stirring wheel to lock with less than  miles on the car has had issues with tire pressure brakes warning lights and then mother of all car stopping all together in the middle of a busy rd due to an oil leak that caused the stirring wheel belt to come off dealer took close to  hrs to send assistance and cannot figure out where the leak is coming from i will never ever buy mb their service stinks for the money one pays anyone even remotely considering this car should really burn their money than risk their childrens life in this car
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,pathetic the infotainment system is the worst i have seen in a luxury car the controls are poorly designed and hard to use the integration of the system is one of the worst i have seen tire pressure sensor is the dumbest i have seen it tells you that pressure is low but you have to figure out in which tire and by how much many of the components failed in the first year of ownership requiring several visits to the dealer oil level sensor was replaced twice within the first  months tires and brakes wore out before k miles blue tooth adapter is a  option but is not well integrated mine failed after  months and  days  i will never again purchase a mercedes
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,extremely slow parts delivery i bought a new  gl end of august  i was in an accident on jan th  took the car to the liberty mutual authorised body shop here in town on the same day its been  weeks now and im still waiting on my car reason i have been told since early feb that they are waiting on the bumper have called mercedes customer service several times have a case manager there who updates me first i was told that  bumpers were on back order then a few days later i was told that  are still on back order frustrating beyond belief i dont think i will ever trust this car maker again
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,total disappointment poor poor quality  cheap plastic inside car has broken and cracked  ac issues works randomly power steering pump leak engine camshaft oil leak  known issue by mercedes with this model  poor paint job clear coat is peeling on roof and front passenger fender  headlight washers popped off nozzlesrear lift gate works intermittently  all in all this is a poorly made car and costs a fortune to upkeep  mercedes should be ashamed to produce such a poor product  i have owned a rolls royce that was cheaper to maintain  i currently have  mls and  gls both the ml are of higher quality and more reliable
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,poor reliability purchased a mint condition  gl with  miles and now at  mileshave had the following problemspower steering pump failure front struts failure interior temperature control system failure check engine sensor failure cam plug oil leaks and replacement back seat panel separation interior vent knobs broke not to mention that the battery wore out early as did the brakes and tiresvehicle pulls to right after repeated alignmentscant get rid of vibration even after tire replacement and repeated rebalancing  suspect drive shaft
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,dissapointment the car is a luxury vehicle k and driving it is really a pleasure i got two kids and did not want to have a van but a nice car that would have a lot of space inside the vehicle is very functional has rd row seats etcetc  i would not review it unless i had quality issues with it  the  speed transmission failed after   miles the suspension failed after   miles warranty expires at   miles  after the two main components of the car failed i cant imagine what breaks next  the engine and everything happened below k miles  expect to put big  after you are out of warranty and those issues keep on occurring
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,mercedes failure well i wrote a review and was very pleased after  weeks after a year i had to get rid of because i could not stand the tiresuspension problems car pulls badly to the right dealer says oh thats just the crown in the road causing that no way wore out tires at  miles and needs an alignment every  months car gets aligned and runs true for a few months before starting to pull again sorry i ever doubted bmw do yourself a favor check out the driving characteristics first if you go on the mecedes forums you will see many have the same disappointment
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,well built fun to drive front end not very smooth it feels like its missing rubber bushings in the front i hope it is an actual mercedes and not just a name change from dodge durango to mercedes gl it will be very disappointing if thats the case otherwise it is a good vehicle also its difficult to lift the middle row to get the rd row
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,change that suspension my gl has been into the dealers not less that four times in under km mainly for suspension problems in this distance i already have had both front and rear shocks changed and whatever else could be changed down there to reduce vibrations road noise  wheelbouncing rear windscreen wiper blade fell off just a few weeks into cars first rainy season  i ended up with a scratched rear screen vibrations have not stopped  make the car unpleasant to drive windows shake ever so slightly but you hear the clickclick all the time you go over a bump i have since learned that  mb has used the same suspension components which are fitted on the ml gl is wider though anyone out there
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,cdigl excellent vehicle needs air pressure to read actual pressure in all tires very expensive to maintain mercedes does unneccessary things on scheduled manintaince such as check caliper thickness at  miles navigation system is one of the worst in the business but not the cheapest  inch tires and wheels are a joke because the tires cost  times as much as  or  inch mb tech fake leather is very bad stuff blue jeans stain it and it does not breath like leather pulls very nice and the brake intregation system is superb but far to priceygarage door opener works only on occasion very weak signal all in all it is a very nice vehicle but mb has made it far to expensive to maintain
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,aweomse i just bought this used with k it got  miles per gallon on average and i drive crazily get the diesel its quiet quick enough and should last forever
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,very smooth drive but expensive to repairmaintain drives like a dream very reliable overall but when something does go bad the cost to repair is usually twice the highest amount you think it could be before taking it to the dealer for example k to switch out the  front shocks and air springs k to switch out the motor on the power gate lift even with that extra cost it is worth it overall
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,worst vehicle ive ever owned thought i did the smart thing trading my lr in for this boy was i wrong desite land rovers reputation  for poor reliability mine had no major issues bought this with  miles on it and a  year warranty thank god i did power liftgate only lowers when it feels like it oil leaks def tank heater oth wheel bearings engine mounts transmission mounts transmission valve body clunking fr front suspension that dealer still hasnt fixed second row seat back will not go back up because center seatbelt will not unlock and allow the belt to come out fuel economy is dismal for a diesel i get about  mpg as long as i dont go above mph shifts at high rpm anything more than driving like a granny makes the rpm go up to  have to manually upshift with the paddles which are very slow to respond and sometimes dont respond  when i first take off in first headed to work the engine spins up as it shifts to second followed by a jerk only does this once during the first drive of the morning then its fine ive owned an ml that was trouble free wish i could get rid of this thing as it has given me more trouble than every other vehicle ive ever owned in my life combined my lr rode alot smoother and the suspension is so freaking slow to raise and lower my land rover raised and lowered in just a couple seconds less than  seconds literally this thing takes a minute or two and raises very very slowly amd when it is raised it rides horribly like it has no suspension the land rover rode good even in off road extended height was getting about  mpg hwy for the first few months now im lucky if i get over  only thing good about this is the compliments people give if they only knew last mercedes ill ever buy think ill go japanese as they are far less troublesome but also boring the lr also held bigger cargo as the roof is taller and the opening is wider despite being a more narrow vehicle than the gl if only the lrlr had a diesel because the fuel economy was why i traded it in for the gl
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,the worst car i have ever owned we purchased a brand new  mercedesbenz gl fully loaded including entertainment and towing packages in january  our problems started the car had just a little over k miles airmatics were gone one after another within days one of them even blew up  electrical problems including radio and door locks allrepairs costed more than  within  months and it continued until we had enough it just started to fall apart after k miles i gave it away for k lost almost  grand in  years i was lucky with that history of repairs do yourself a favor get a japanese car our time hard earned money and peace of mind are valuable stay away of this car and brand
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,care for this has all the required service timely and fully performed almost new brakes new tires and a new diesel particulate filter emissions inspection for  years  has been well taken care of with normal wear and tear nav system updated i  have sold the car for the maintenance after  miles became very expensive and on going every month or so
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,worst experience ever bought used gl and told the wife it was a mercedes they been making diesel cars forever first few months oil o ring goes to the tune of four months later timing chain stretched for about   two weeks later windshield leaks and rusts connections to air bag module   one month later rear wheel bearing goes bad for thats over  in repairs in just over a year funny part is  rings and modules have been recalled on other  models not a happy mercedes man
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,not that great the car has terrible blind spots  the sideview mirrors are way too small  the safety warning systems for changing lanes do not help that much  the transmission bangs when changing gears at low speeds  the engine hesitates nearly all the time when accelerating  it chokes out like a gas engine in cold weather makes for a dangerous situation when trying to pass  decent mileage for a big car but the highway mileage never approach the ratinghave gone thru a few winters  very reliable in all road conditions  averaging between  mpg to  mpg   to  miles between fillups  have gotten used to the poor mirrors to some degree but i still turn around to change lanes  the transmission does not bang as much at low speeds  bought new tires at  miles brakes front and back at  miles
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,worst car experience will never own a mercedes againnonstop moneypit from the day i bought it to the day i sold itbeware the air suspension on mercedesbenzmine went out every six months or sopaint peeled off around the windows just when it was out of warrantyi estimate i spent  a year in repairsit is also a huge gas guzzler
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,gl falling apart at k miles ive got a  gl with k milesmy wife drives it for light suburban driving onlyin general we like the vehicle but it has been in the shop at least every three monthswe are now out of warranty and have had a flood of issues in the past monththree weeks ago the driverside door lock mechanism went outthe audio radio phone everything went out last week and the system needed to be resetthis week both front struts went out and nearly killed her car was out of controlthe bill for the struts and the doorlock is k but the dealer offered to pickup some of the tabive owned a lot of new mercedes but wont buy another one
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,lemon flavored diesel purchase this car in  with k miles on it for around k  got an extend warranty for the car and glad we did  the entire rack and pinion steering system had to be replaced at k miles which was paid by warranty with a cost of around   the heating element for the def tank went out at a cost of  and the entire tank had to be replaced since they heater is sealed in the tank that was paid out of our pocket then we got the dreaded oil cooler leak which is a very common issue on almost every gl diesel which cost right around  to fix as the most the engine has to be taken apart in order to replace the  oil cooler gasket  had huge diesel fuel leak due to oring issues with the fuel filter another  spent to fix that  then i the air bag compressor failed  to replace that then had  air bag fail another   the rear power lift gated failed at cost of close to  to replace it the final nail in the coffin was the sale of the vehicle for   we had lots safety recalls with the airbags but mercedes has failed to do anything to replace them and keep pushing it off claiming that they do not have the parts to replace it and because of these recall no dealer is able to resell the vehicle till mercedes fixes the issue making it nearly a worthless suv  sticker price on this suv new was  as it had every option available on it  stay away stay away and please google all the known issue with these vehicles dont let our mistake be your mistake
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,has bad side too i have this vehicle for over  months and stumbled into a common mistake and filled up with gas costing around  to remove the gas when i did not started the car and realize while fueling if you start it may cost you  very delicate fuel and exhaust system
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,is it a benz or a hyundai very disappointting for those of you guys who are seeking the good ole fashion quality of the benz a word of advise shy away  the x of the year can not sustain a small bump from the side walk curve without busting its air suspension module  interestingly enough when taking the vehicle to the local benz dealership the service manager told me  hey this car is just like a kia and a hyundai what do you expect its build the same i was floored by the lack of cooperation and needless to say the poor craftsmanship  if i wanted a kia i would buy one well maybe i should have it is a shame that a k x of the year is basically a kia with a mercedes star on it
Mercedes-Benz,,gl  gl
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior, gl  luxury compared to newer models leather dashboard and materials wife loves the car and room and third row seat
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,gl is not an suv i dont understand why edmunds keep placing this vehicle on the first place among luxurious suvs i have followed edmunds advice and had one for a year i may say with full responsibility that  gl is not a real suv it is a crossover on a rough road it fails  the cockpit has a low ceiling toll person cant get in without bending neck  reliability is low within less than a year i had to go to dealer for repairs twice one of them could have been quite expensive if not under warranty  among all bells and whistles just a few make sense others look attractive for a regular customer but are useless  third raw is for two years old only besides an adult would have a hard time to get there and so onanyway after approximately a year i have traded it in to lexus lx yes this thing has less bells and whistles but it is a real suv yes its voice recognition system sucks and navigation system is not as good as mb gl but if you are about to purchase a luxurious suv go anywhere type do not make a mistake being attracted by mb logo on a hood
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,gl amg not a vehicle for daily use gl not recommended by me as a value purchase for daily use  after just k miles ive had two sets of brakes k each and two sets of tires k each  oil change is only annual but runs   voice recognition in my gl is not user friendly and must only understand german  navigation is poorer than any car i owned unrealiable inconsistent quirky freezes and just dont work  as i commented  voice recognition is the worst  the door auto unlocking doesnt always work   i can not justify purchasing another gl amg   just not enough for the money k  need to trade before another set of brakes tires or oil change  wonder power but i guess im just not rich enough
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,two year update i would not buy this suv again just got this family mover four months ago it is no doubt a beautiful truck and is loaded with all kinds of technological gizmos however that may be its downfall because a multitude of annoyances keep cropping up and sending us to the dealer led lights not working tire sensor failure power seat failure etc finally one morning the car was dead in the garage a k car that would not give any sign of life or start with only  miles on board had to have it towed to the dealer where they are still trying to figure out what happened update regarding the above problem they found out that one of the air suspension shocks valve shorted and it drained the battery the piece was replaced and the problem was solved weve now owned this vehicle for over two years and had to change the tires twice already both under k miles the dealer said that the lower profile tires with softer rubber are the reason perhaps but that combined with quite a bit of wheel camber and directional tires makes for rapid uneven wear of the tires requiring changing them early at the tune of  each tire something to keep in mindwe also had multiple issues with the ac system developing an unpleasant musty smell we live in florida and ac is a must it is humid here and there is something about the pipes that causes them to retain condensation and moisture leading to this issue the ac has been flushed and sanitized multiple times but the unpleasant smell persistsusb connectivity for this year model was poor and difficult to set up their remote app is also difficult to use and of limited functionality regarding navigation i routinely use google maps in my phone now as it surpasses anything cars navigation can offeralso we had to bring the car in several times for tire balancing and alignment due to recurrent vibration at speeds above mph after the service things improved but the ride always has a significant amount of vibration this is more glaring when i compare it to our other car a land rover that has a fantastic ride at all speeds disappointing at this price rangeoverall i would not buy this particular model from mercedes perhaps it has too many parts from chrysler i dont know but many annoyances and quality problems
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,in the shop every other week i can look back and guarantee on paper my gl goes in the shop almost every other week i am very disappointed  comparing this car to our lexus the lexus has been in the shop at k for the key fob not working and to clean the ac filter due to a smellas for the gl we have been in the shop all the time for  brakes sensors squealing brakes oil leak rear shock for rear door was not working transmission trouble squeaking window right front air shock had to be replaced the shock is still making noises when you go over a speed bump  bad design glove box that cant store much and always gets jammed very cheap center wheel caps that need replacing all the time so many sensors you will be in the shop getting them replaced and while you are there you  might as well do your high price service that can run up to  yes  and that is with out getting anything fixed the service is to keep your car under the mb warranty and if you dont decline the service it will void the warranty  i feel like i keep the dealership lights on while they look for there next person that is as uneducated as i was when i bought this big rolling pieces of junkwhen i pull up next to some one with a mercedes i feel bad for themi know this for a fact most people that work for the mercedes dealership dont drive mercedes but if they do they usually are driving it for freeone mechanic stated to me that he likes the mb but due to the high price of parts he stays awayif you buy a mercedes or a gl and you feel like nothing is going your way remember i told you so
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,dependable but needing repairs needs egr valve  passenger outside mirror needs replacement needs front bumper needs window motor in driver door
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,piece of junk i bought it from my sister with very low mileage and extremely well maintained now i refer to this poorly built suv as a piece of junk it is plauged with problems i have had interior parts falling off and breaking sun roof deflectors broke and looking at the cheap plastic used in the build really disappointed me then the brake fluid drum breaks makes funny noises when driving and recently jerks badly when stopping at a light now a paint sealant or something seems to be peeling off at the back and dealer wants  a pop since i have run out of warranty if anybody is intrested in filing a law suit please count me in

Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,not competitive with other suvs in class  mbz doesnt hold its value at trade in
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,beware of the brake this ml was meant for my wife and she does love this suv  but the biggest problem with it is the braking system  it was a nightmare  the disc only lasted less than k over the yrs of ownership  we have spend over k on the brake job alone  as i have found out that mb has one of the worst braking systems in the world and the worst part is that they insisted there are nothing wrong with it  i strongly suggest all consumers not to purchase mb until they resolve the problems  most of the other problems are minimum as it comes with all luxory cars  we drive bmws now its a step down  but at the least we dont have to worry about the maintenance
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,ml sports car performance with suv cargo
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,do not buy mb and please inform others do not purchase this vehicle i wish i can show the receipt for this vehicle because youre better off buying a vehicle from other sources because the amount of payment for repair is not equal to owning this vehicle i need a time machine to talk to myself of never purchasing cosigning this vehicle because the quality is all aesthetic and each part of the vehicle is expensive with expensive mechanics that will siphon as much money from you as they can mercedes benz seems to rely their profit from consumers paying and over paying for maintenance that should not be required where is the picture upload for my receipt in which these people are trying to steal money from me after purchasing these vehicles  please please boycott mercedes benz dealers and mercedes benz products
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,never buy an ml just traded in the  mercedes ml with  miles on it worst car ever reliability was terrible resell is horrible basic maintenance is extremely expensive had battery troubles alternator troubles and electronic troubles horrible design electrical boards are under the seats so you cant get anything wet one time the wipers alarm and locks went off just because the battery was dying again automatic liftgate never worked sick and tired of mercedes and will never buy again traded it in for a  acura rdx
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,ml  dont touch one if you research this vehicle you will find they have problems with the balance shaft and this equals expensive repairs mb will not admit a problem exists but the blogs show this to be untrue they have also introduced a replacement read upgrade kit to address their non existent problemsmy experience has been that a cog on the balance shaft has disintegrated causing much internal damage the engine had to be removed and parts replaced  hours labour can you afford the riski currently have  mbs but will not touch another one
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,very disappointed i purchased my first benz and positively my last the suv in general was pretty good until a couple of months later after i purchased it brand new its been a nightmare since then something had to be fixed every now and thenat least  times a yearwhen it was still under warrantyit wasnt a big deal then big things started breaking after the warranty expired i can now say its a piece of junk my  lexus rx s and a nissan pathfinder in the past had not been in the shop for repairs collectively as my ml was finally got rid of it and traded it for an infiniti whew what a relief
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,buy extended warranty maintainence dealership charges  for glorified oil change schedule c have had for  yrs only about  miyr  now my warranty is up last month  only  mi i have had numerous transmission problems only the mercedes dealership will take care of it have spent over  since warranty out
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,the big let down this car is a big let down we are so done with this car the transmission makes so much noise the shifter is in a bad position the loud noise from the engine we have had the car serviced so many times trying to find out about the engine problem slipping of the transmission our  ml gave us no problems we should have kept it with k miles sadly disappointed
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,extremely disappointed i bought the first car of this new model in  and it has been hell ever since  at some point the dealership offered to give me a new car for additional k  i bought the car cash hoping not to worry about buying a car for a long while  i have the ml  and it has worked very well for us so i assumed this would be the same  to start when the roads are wet or there is a little wind the car feels like it is being blown off the road and i have had this since day one initially they told me that it might be the tires but that wasnt it  the car has had so many problems that at one point it spent  days at the dealership and they still couldnt figure out what was wrong with it
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,they could have done better i want to love mercedes but they always go wrong mechanically is where this car falls  for an normal service is way too much and cost for other small repairs are ridiculous like  for a new key battery we only have about  miles on ours and every morning on a cold start there is a clicking noise coming from under the car also the steering vibrates a little on the highway and shakes when your ride over a pothole
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,a horriible let down we purchased our car in  we were absolutely thrilled three months later my car broke down in the middle lane on the highway every light came on inside and the care died it was the engine the dealer replaced the engine after having my car in the shop for two weeks a month later there was a nick in the transmission which required another stay in the shop  months later two recalls were fixed this car was a horrible let down you can hear and feel the car shift gears we are actually looking for another car to buy i have two kids and it does not offer the reliability that a mom would feel comfortable driving it was truly a let down
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,solid very solid mechanics and luxury features terrific pick up and passing abilities truly quiet ride  cr blew the call on this one
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,disappointed buyer a few months after purchasing my vehicle the air bag light came on the problem was fixed but another problem came up the coolant level indicator appeared recently the car has been brought in for steering bearing problems and the transmission jerks the steering bearing computer module and transmission valve has been replaced but the car still jerks i have brought the car in for this problem  times now they are telling me that the jerking is normal ive never driven a car that jerks so i dont think its normal im so disappointed that i bought a mercedes and it turned out to be a piece of crap i thought mercedes makes good quality cars thats why its so expensive
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,bad dealership bad car this is the bottom line worst car i have ever purchased and the dealership is even worse than the cari purchased an ml  days after i purchased the car it had to go in for service and in less than  months the car has been in  timeseverything from the rear hatch not working constant problem sunroof cam shafts leaking oil leaking random lights not working battery going dead for no reason and stranding me and the last one was the ac going out completelyof course out of  times in the dealership my service advisor who is the only decent part of this experience does not know what to do except to schedule me for service for next month in advance because she knows soon so
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,exterior design does it for ml hands down rides much nicer than bmw x needs leather standard on a vehicle of this caliber brakes are a little mushy if i had to complain at all
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance, ml   be careful toyota fans nothing less than what i expected from mercedes youve done it again  performance like ive never seen before comfort plus unbelievable speed  not for the toyotalexus girls  guys this is way too much vehicle for you  thank you mercedes benz
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,disappointed as the owner of three mls since  currently a  special edition i went into my local dealer today to test drive a new one i love the exterior styling and wanted to love the interior but was very disappointed by everything the gearshift on the steering column  what were they thinking and the mbtec standard fake leather is ridiculous on a supposed luxury car inside much cheaper looking overall so my love affair with mls is coming to an end my heart is considering buying the one i have now but my head is telling my to give serious consideration to the acura mdx i test drove yesterday  dont care much for the look but its all around higher rated and a better value im sad
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,not enough for the price  we were previously dedicated bmw owners however a lack of incentive programs on the new xs led me to mercedes the vehicle we bought is pathetically equipped we did buy an entry level model only  but even at that price one would assume you would get some of the basics i am very disappointed in the lack of features here is a list of what the vehilce does not have that all of my previous bmws came with as standard  xenon headlights rain sensing windsheild wipers no songartist title on radio display power lift gate child locks on rear doors believe that one driver power seat memory rear climate control
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,do not trade your lexus for it i get used to my  lexus navigation system and now i am not able to find a starbucks coffee in la according to mercedesbenz the closed starbucks is in oregon the height of the inside mirror is not adjustable and tall people like me will need to lie down on the passenger sit making the right turn the half of storage compartment is used by the bluetooth adapter so you can store only a pair of glasses in it there are hidden costs after purchasing the vehicle you will discover that you have to pay extra  for the bluetooth adapter standard with the lexus navigation system the car runs smoothly and has a lot of power but these small things may spoil the fun of driving it
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,luxurious but practical before i bought my ml  i did test drove a bmw x and acura mdx in terms of refinement nothing beats the merc the x is very heavy and the acura sounds laboring in acceleration this car combines luxury with practicality
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,this is not a real mercedes a chrysler of the s when your long term trusting mechanic tells you need to get rid of the vehicle you just bought for for  thousand and has less than k miles should have red flagged me for the pain i was about to receive by far the worst vehicle ive ever owned in my entire life  when the bills for repairs of the turbo intake valve problems transmission blu tec and tail light problems equaled more in the car than it was worth i gave it away just  years later up at auction for  a k loss for a car i thought i would have for  years plus  i will never buy a chryslermercedes dodge or jeep ever again
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,worst invest i am going back to honda i purchased the ml cd as an upgrade to my  honda which after  thousand miles no major problems never expected a mcb suv will give me gray hair i have changed several parts that in a less cheaper care start going bad close to  years cd player went bad the door lock went bad on the driver side one week later the passenger side is gone the tire pressure sensor same story bulbs blow weekly now oxygen sensor need changing  changed the inlet port motor and now the disel filter need to change the care is loosing power esp on an incline the engine light is forever on and the list goes on and on i have spent at  for the year in repairs plus service i  am fed up angry
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,"expensive piece of crap after  yrs of owning the ml cdi i do have a lot of problems and expenses the check engine light never ends the lights always have to be changed at least every  months as of this time my suv has  miles and the vehicle is in and out of the dealer cannot fix the check engine light i already spend almost   the vehicle has been there for a good  month waiting for parts then bring it home drive for  miles check engine comes back they change a lot of parts the suv also has problem with acceleration and the engine now is sonoisy when you drive it i thought this was the best vehicle i bought this was the worst of all the brands i have"
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,worst car ive owned my hyundai was more reliable my  ml is a major disappointment with numerous technological issues it has been to the dealer for repairs more than any car i have ever owned i am again driving a loaner for the th time in a year and a half i have recorded videos of the malfunctions dealer has duplicated the issues on occasion and it is still not fixed i contacted mbusa for assistance and resolution and they did nothing except say take it to the dealer i cannot believe that mercedes would have such poor response and pathetic customer service after years of contemplating purchasinga luxury vehicle i am hugely disappointed that my first experience is so negative i should have the reliability i paid for
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,look elsewheremercedes has lost its edge recently leased the new  ml  and what a disappointment interior fit and finish not up to usual mercedes quality and required replacement partson a new mercedes ride is terrible there is a problem with the rear suspension that makes this car bounce like crazy over any little road bump and the dealer claims there is nothing wrong the precise handling i have read about in other reviews of this car is completely lacking in the car i gotmy honda minivan drove with less effort i am so sorry i got this car and especially at over  per month for the lease the bmw x drives much much better maybe i should just go back to my honda
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,terrible service from mercedes in  i researched purchasing either a mercedes or acura i had exceptionally great service with acura in the past but chose mercedes and assumed their service would meet the same expectation i was wrong i ordered running boards over a year ago and still have not received them i now had to take my rubber drivers side mat into dealership due to a recall and am told not to hold my breath for the new onemercedes called me to say i would be put on their preferred listbut still have not received these items and they could not give me an eta on them waiting over a year for parts is insane i wonder what the future will hold when i need serviceparts ordered i looked at acura today
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,the worst vehicle i ever own i purchased my  ml bluetec back in november after  weeks the first problem i had was car was pulling to the right at highway speedafter left it with the dealer for about a week they finally realized that it was bad tire which took them a few more days to get replacementnext i was having problem with car loosing power when driving over a long distance or for a few hoursthere is no error message on the dashboard nor that the dealer can replicateanyway i start documenting them on video using my phonethey finally acknowledge but still no solution for italong with the car loosing power i was getting error with presafe inoperative error and adblue low level

Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,ml  very poor ride i am very unhappy with the ride mb should be ashamed no wonder they are loosing market share like anything what the hell were they thinking when they designed the suspension system for this thing  ml with   the other problem which my dealer tells me is normal  all tires are feathering a lot he tells me this is normal i am supposed to change the tires every  miles   my god the ride is just so bad   mins ride and your body is ready to fall a part  never expected a donut size tire either with mb when others have full size spare  dont know what to do with this
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,more problems than you would expect i purchased  mercedes in   ml  s and  e  the mls had fuse box fans that squealed for a half hour in the morning  serious brake and tire problems  each ml required new tires at  miles each has had the brakes replaced twice in  miles   for brakes  at  miles the brakes squeal so bad they are embarrassing to drive   each has been in about a dozen times for various repairs  top dollar inferior quality design problems and miserable service  avoid these automobiles

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,delivered unit not equal to the test car the car wanders  needs to be constantly corrected  the steering is deadsloppy in the center position steering wheel will not return to center and must be pulled back the engine idle is rough  goes up and down and causes a vibration in the cabin at the low idle point braking at times hits a sticking point that can be pushed through but then the brakes comes on hard and fast at  miles and multiple trips to the dealer i recieved no help from the dealer or mb usa i asked them to purchase back the car the answer was no  my advice  dont purchase this car it is not the quality product i expected  the dealership was pompous when i tried to explain my concerns and dissatisfaction
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,ml   leased a new ml upon learning my  c needed extensive repairs they just dont make mercedes like they used too drove off the lot and have enjoyed this suv to date  month no problem so farhowever mercedes has the worst navigation system ever created  what happened mercedes  you introduced the airbags abs brakes premium stereos and a host of other things to the auto industry  now you have fallen behind in basic standard electronic gadgets that even gm and lexus are light years ahead   shape up mercedes because the next carsuv i buy might be a lexus
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,wasted money my  ml has k miles and it is the worst car i ever had the car had multiple repairs on windshieldsunroof motors various sensors and transmission parts but worst of all is the security system for the last  years keys had to be changed  times   a piecedue to a faulty chip they also had to be changed every time the battery would be gone i was stuck several times and had to interrupt a trip and be towed once you reach a total of  keys you have to change locks and computer parts approx  when tried to complain to mb they have a standard answer keys are not covered by warranty and there is nothing we can do dealing with mb service is very frustrating experience
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,poor drive i was expecting a lot more from a mercedes  this has to be one of the poorest performing cars in its class the handling is poor and vague the accelerator is vague and the brakes are vague  this car has vague written all over it  what is it really for mercedes made a stab at the suv market and in my opinion failed miserably the one thing that they do well with this vehicle is having mercedez benz luxury  its great to be driven in thiscar but its horrible when it comes to driving it  it gives me no confidenceno power and no feel

Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,reliability this is my nd m class purchased the first model and was disappointed with all the problems it had gave mb another chance because of their reputation believing they would fix all the issues bad decision  i only have k miles and its been to the shop so many times i lost count mechanical problems resulted in replacing the main computer k miles power steering pump went out at k miles numerous sensors and fuel system components minor exterior and interior broken plastic parts are also a disappointment i have gotten to know my mechanic very well forget mb and the status symbol every time i see an mb i see my mechanics shop not very reliableonly a name
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,big disappointment i bought this car as a starmark certified vehicle from mercedes  almost immediately i noticed some issues two exterior plastic body pieces spontaneously broke interior plastic parts seemed prone to breakage as well  also the breaks were very noisey and fluttery dealer told me to live w  eventually more serious ie expensive issues arose fuel injectors became blocked spark plugs fouled coils needed replacement power steering line ruptured all within  miles of purchase  of the thousands of dollars in repair bills virtually nothing was covered by the mercedes starmark warranty shockingly poor quality esp from a company with such a premium reputation and price tag

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance, ml ive had the ml for  weeks now with  miles performance is acceptable i have been disappointed with the car few days after owning the vehicle started the vehicle in garage noticed two problems  white smokes only happened once  notice an engine knocks on cold start listen carefully make sure radio is off squeals noise coming from steering column and passenger driver drive seat moves under my knee during acceleration rough idle more wind noise than my ford suv
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,piece of junk never buy a mercedes they are not reliable mechanically the suv spent more time in the shop than on the road diesels are not the way to go because you will have to replace the dpf filter at a cost of  to  dollars short trips the kill the dpf filter faster that is almost half the value of the suv mercedes should be sued for allowing this piece of junk on the road i will never own another mercedes again the diesel engine which you can google and read about is junk the engine is an om the engine oil is  dollars a quart and it drinks it at a rate of  quart every  miles do the math on that one the urea tank heater will fail which is  dollars i think it is also a bad great idea to not have a spare tire either and no place to put one
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,not for family of  with kids we bought the bluetec for the fuel economy and the exterior styling  little did we know that it is not designed for tall or larger people  i weigh lbs and  tall so i am not big  it is very uncomfortable to come in and out of the drivers seat with the seat back my kid does not have leg room from his car seat  i move the seat forward and have to drive uncomfortably  the rear entertainment is mounted very poorly in the back that my  year old has bumped his head hard  times  i do not recommend it for family of  with kids  with the  car seats it is very difficult to seat   the fuel economy is averaging around mpg which is not bad diesel is sufficient for daily drive
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,very disappointed in mercedes  i have to echo many of the complaints already on this site  weve owned ours for yrs during which time weve spent slightly over k in repairs  if fact its in the garage now  repairs include new transmission brakes wiring and various other items  short list of quality issues wind noise above  mph is intolerable brakes make all kinds of noise at low speed head liner likes to fall off paint on side molding also likes to fall off and a never ending list of repairs which are all very expensive
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,i want to sell the it first time suv owner i feel ml is really a truck rather than a car high performance engine very responsive handling strong feedbacks from the road these also come with noisy engine rough ride for driver and passengers bad gas mileage have driven other suvs ml is worst in term of comfort long distance ride will not be fun for passengers interior is simple and dull window control cruise control and cup holder seem in strange place not very intuitive lack of standard features such as seat bel sensors trunk open sensors trip computers no luxury features
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,all wheel drive eats tires in  mi my ml ruined a set of tires in  mile  the dealer says i didnt rotate enough  they were rotated and balanced at    at   at  at  i think the all wheel drive is eating the tires my dealer wont do anything no other dealer will do anything  so at  miles im losing  just to get rid of this lemon  pretty sad  ive had other mercedes but this piece of junk is my last  this vehicle vibrates like a piece of junk  im embarrased for mb   they should be ashamed

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,terribly unreliable i have had more problems with this vehicle than all seven other vehicles i have owned combined granted i did buy it with k miles on it none of these things should be going wrong with a mercedes benz i have had ujoints fail bolts on both sides of my front suspension break twice electronicsgo out on the center dashboard three ignition coils fail and the ac compressor has gone out aside from that it has a rough ride like riding in a sports car without the fun much of the car uses cheap materials that can not hold up to everyday use it does have decent performance for the size vehicle it is though
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,awful vehicle all around i dont know what you people giving this car a good review are smoking but what i do know is that drugs are badive had about  vehicles so far and the  ml is the most awful poorly built unreliable thing not a car that has ever been sold on this galaxythe car was well kept and still it has k miles only running because i have basically rebuild the darn thingeverything on the car has gone bad a few things such as clutch fan ac compressor coldhot air selector motor have actually been changed a few timesother than that name it radiator electrical components all cabin controls for everything drive shaft bearing catalytic converter suspension etc went bad
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,do not buy the  model this car is awful bought it at k and now has  at  had to change oxygen sensors  each so  engine coolant started leaking at k had to change the radiator  this car is just awful good comfort
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,an suv that keeps falling apart this clunker i own has kept falling apart since  accordion skylight roof control died within  months head lamp burned out in  month rear cargo bay plastic sidewall cracked up and broken in  years windows driver side windows control died in  years one headlamp light bulb burned out in  months lamp cover leaking water inside and got cataractlike problem that blocked light seriously bad chair design that has blocked blood circulation in my right thigh every time i drive no lumbar support that caused back pain many mysterious noises all the time while driving terrible oem general tires that made the rear part skidded so dangerously every time turned super gas guzzler
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,junk everything starts falling apart at about k weve spent well over k in repairs in the last  mo and i was just told that weve got an entire page of other issues that need to be addressed as i had it at the dealer for our third recall last recall we paid  in repairs before they issued the recall after telling us theyd reimburse us we had to wait  months before mercedes did so and only after we had to start legal action mb is not even close to being in toyotas league its disgraceful what they charge for these vehiclesservice and unfair that only a dealer can check fluids mb service shouldnt be required to keep the vehicle from repairs
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,great design and ride but quality stinks i have owned a  ml since new and it now has  miles on it i love the ride and utility of the vehicle and to be fair it has never failed to start nor has it ever stranded me except when the battery failed and then a nice mb tech arrived to replace it at cost of battery  that said the quality stinks  the car has been in the shop about  times for various bits and pieces failing or falling off  everything from rusting lug nuts within  days of new to a failed steering sensor requires replacement of entire steering column  this car is expensive and annoying to keep on the road  final insult is that now the drivers door has penetrating rust buy a honda pilot instead
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,dont buy i had one problem after another sorry

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,i hate this car we bought this car with  miles on it it was great the first two years minor things going wrong only after that many little things went and each part was very expensive check engine light was on almost always usually sensors but all the time it drove me crazy the suv was very comfy and had all the bells and whistles but not worth the hassle of needing to be fixed all the time i am getting rid of it tomorrow and it will not be missedwe have a leak in the front that no one can figure out where it comes from too

Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,ml i waited a while to write this review because of the negatives i have read about the mercedesbenz ml i purchased this truck as a certified used vehicle other than the poor fuel economy i could not be happier service on this truck has been far cheaper than on my previous mercedesbenz wagon some of the interior trim has a little trouble wih the dogmeaning he broke it i love the gps and the bose stereo i am at  miles and the truck still looks close to new one other problem is that the odd tire size means very few choices for replacements

Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,an expensive meds terrible ride quality rides like a stoneterrible seats firm and not comfortableterrible offroad large wheel and thin tires make for a scary off road situationgood acceleration and breakingmercedes has lost their way with their ml suv the suspension clatters and bangs over every crack on the road the transmission shifts abrubtly all of the time and with the large wheels and thin tires it is terrible off road the seats are very uncomfortable the only pros i can speak of as an owner are the reliability
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,swag this car drives like a sports car just traded in our  ml for this model
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,mercedes technology learn from lexus this is the second ml awd that i have owned so my review applies to the  which had engine problems misfiring and the  which has keyless go technology problems both items were reported to mercedes many times and in both cases mercedes provided no satisfaction and no ability to find the problem and repair it on the  near the end of my ownership just prior to trading the car in mercedes came out with and performed some sort of software upgrade on the engine and it finally fixed the misfiring this problem had gone on for almost three years with mercedes denying there was a problem and telling me that it was the gasoline i was purchasing which was the same i had used in my many lexus suvs for previous  years on my current  the keyless go fails more than it works and the car continues to get confused when there are two keys near the car my wife always carries her key to my car when we ride together and the mercedes keyless go is unable to switch between the keys and work  consistently recently we have had a problem where my wife was in the car and unable to get out and i was outside with my key and unable to get in which would have been a disaster in an emergency the car has been in the shop at least  times for this problem but mercedes denies there is a problem and will not switch out the computer that handles this part of the technology or has been unable to fix the problem i have made videos of the failure which i was asked by my service manager at mercedes to do to proof the failure was happening and there are numerous reports of the problem online but similar to my engine problem in the  mercedes is unable or unwilling to address and repair the problem other than the problems we have liked the ml and we also own the glk  but i am very unhappy with the way mercedes addresses their own issues with their technology having been a lexus owner since lexus came out with their suvs and with toyota before that the switch to mercedes has been difficult as their customer service and their ability to make their technology work still needs improvement update  in january  mercedes service replaced the keyless go computer and the keyless go worked correctly for a short time before it started to fail again now it has gotten much worse often will not recognize one of the keys and still does not have the ability to switch between the two keys mercedes has a long way to go in being able to service and fix their own technology issues i have now had this car for  months and keyless go still does not work properly
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,class action law suit dont buy a sprinter van we had trouble with our x van within  month i brought in van  times and dealer cant find problem the van hesitates and skips in all weather terrains and withwithout loads upon acceleration or just driving we used a loaner sprinter van that was not a xr and that one skipped randomly too even the guy who sold us the van admitted that yeah weve been having trouble with those vans we called mercedes benz corporate and complained they gave us the run around with no solutions now we are proceeding with a lemon law complaint with our states attorney generals office its been a nightmare dealing with mercedes benz they know there is a problem
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance, year old cargo van k miles  x repairs  mercedes benz is hiding in plain sight behind their tristar badge in the past this was a respected brand but today you are better off moving to a different brand as these vehicles are absolute junk i purchased a new  sprinter  and after only k miles and  year of ownership my cargo high roof van has visited the dealer  times for check engine light steering column replacement a plethora of electronic issues and black gunk dripping out of the roof ribs in the cargo area  leaking black sealant on tools and new product for my clients told by mercedes dealer that my van is not a problem child i even tried to trade my van in at the dealer i purchased from and was told by the sales manager that they did not want my van as they could not resell it with all the problems it has i went through mbusa and they basically have done nothing to stand behind their product do not buy mercedes  bad product  built poorly  poor quality
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,sprinter
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,for business these rust out before they run out either very cheap steel or poor constructionrust like crazy
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,worst investment ever sprinter is a money sucker where do i begin  the radio is a possessed and worthless waste of space battery drains stops working for no reason finally just had to pull the fuse and ride silent for the last  months or so i owned it  defdpf issues  these engines and system has never gotten the bugs worked out oil recommended my mb specs read required cannot handle the  degrees that the engines put out to try and burn off the soot these engines eventually destroy themselves from the inside out  egr valve clogs def tank sensors nx sensors fail and once this starts it is thousands of dollars in repairs  ranging from about  to up to   the om engine is said by some a ticking timebomb if it doesnt fail it will most certainly drain your wallet and your desire to continue to want to own it  speaking of service regular mercedes dealerships want nothing to do with these they dont want to service them  i had diehard diesel mechanics who refused to work on my sprinter  on a sprinter forum people have mechanics just throw parts at problems to the tune of thousands of dollars to not actually fix the problem and they suggest driving your sprinter to golden colorado to have a guy repair it im serious  lightbulbs i changed nearly every lightbulb on this van felt like it was a fulltime job the headlights will blow if you hit a bad pothole advice by diehards just carry spares    speaking of what to carry with you suggestion is to carry a scanner with you at all times to diagnose problems  why should i have to carry a scan tool with me to drive daily  that is ludicrous  i sold my sprinter  years to the day and only put  miles on it when i owned it  the longest i went without a check light on the dash was  days  i thought i was buying quality i had hoped to run it to  miles  it started its death cycle at around k  i feel bad for the person who bought it from the dealer i traded it into  they have nothing to look forward to other then other than defdpf problems and costly repairs in the thouand in the very near future
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,disappointed  again and again im a courier  i drive about  miles per year  this is my second sprinter a   a   the reason i bought  was the cargo capacity and interior height  at the time of purchases there was no comparable vans  now there are  service is very expensive as you are buying mercedes parts  dealership service locations are few and far between  both vans had deep surface rust before  years i didnt even know vehicles could rust anymore  this is the most unstable tractionwise vehicle i have ever owned  i use snow tires year round  never again for meupdated review  in the last  miles i have spent more than  in a failed attempt to consistently get fuel from the gas tank to the engine  the service techs are still trying to figure out the problem
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,very disappointing we bought the sprinter  brand new in  with ltv rv serentity motorhome  on our first extended vacation we have had  breakdowns  we travelled from florida to colorado for the first half of the trip and the engine blew an oil seal in montrose colorado going up a long grade  oil covered the engine and body of the vehicle  this was repaired although oil continued to leak for several more days residual on vehicle body  three weeks later the engine lost power and would only run at  to  mph on i  heading toward butte montana  we almost lost our lives when this happened  we were able to drive it into missoula montana to the dealership  the next day service said there was a wiring harness problem and they ordered new parts overnight but dont expect to have the vehicle repaired for  days  we called mercedes customer care for assistance with trip interruption expenses  we were told that the sprinter line of vehicles is specifically excluded from their concierge customer care program  so here we areon vacation stranded in missoula and unable to continue to glacier national park our dream destination and we are stuck with unplanned expenses and non reimbursable reservations  we know that all vacations have to come to an end but never would i have guessed that mercedes would be the cause of that it is really so sad that a once great vehicle manufacturer could become so bad and that they could care less about you as a customer
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance, months and  miles  bought new cash vehicle has been in to schumacher mercedes in scottsdale more than  times since it hit k miles esp failure excessive play on the steering gears slamming into wrong gear this van is literally killing my business with how unreliable it has become i bought the van brand new and since it hit k miles it has been in  times for the same repairs can anyone say lemon i am currently waiting patiently for a mercedes benz usa buy back  getting ready to hand this over to a lawyer to handle while mb usa drags their feet slowly this van is the most expensive work van i have ever owned and its been a huge disappointment  steering column has been replaced with multiple electronic modules and most of the time im limping around to my jobs in limp mode with the check engine light on go in for warranty repair and a week later the check engine and esp failure lights are back on i hate this van  its garbage buyer beware still struggling with check engine light every  miles vehicle goes back in to dealer this next week for fix number  check engine light
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,too darn complex the owners manual says to read it before driving your new vanthe sales folks wont tell you that itd take you a couple days to do thatthis is one complex machine  the poorly written manual only makes it worsehad i read it st i wouldnt have  bought this van i get  mpg have only  miles on it so far and have driven it only in snowymountainous countryit is so complex i dont like to drive itam a retiredfor  years fireman with a lot of diesel fire truck experience  but this mb diesel is a different animal i did put nokian snow tires on it  they work wellmine is a  wheel drivei have a  gmc all wheel drive van that i will neverever get rid ofits reliable  simple
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior, mercedes sprinter
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value, pit the emissions system will cost tens of thousands of dollars potentially  after  the fist multi thousand dollar repair of the def tank pump occurred  at  the repairs landslides with def multiple codes and poor mileage  my chevy van was a relic yet ran and ran to   this think is bankrupting me  repairs this year are one  for the emission system  it runs at night and i cant sleep wondering when the next call will come with another breakdown and a  price tag
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,piece of garbage on wheels or worse when i bought my  x sprinter i thought it was going to be amazing by the third day i realized i had made a mistake the van had a very bad noise coming from the back it got worse then the roof leaked i had to drive it  hours to the nearest dealer to get it fixed and i had not even gotten it home yet i fought with them over a rental as it was less than a week old took  days to fix while i was stranded and unable to work  the fixs didnt work and i entered into a months long battle to get repairs done ultimately the van spent most of the first  days in the shop with no loaner it is legally a lemon and mb usa agreed to buy it back but that was months ago and they have said nothing since the people who work at corporate have no integrity to their word and they refuse to put anything in writing i paid k for a van i have not been able to use when i did use it for its intended purpose cross country trips i was able to get just shy of k on the van before the power steering went out on a mountain switchback that put it back in the shop for more than a month and they have no explanation for how the hose came loose and after more than k in parts and expenses working on the vibrationnoise from the suspension they come to the conclusion it is natural harmonics of the van again not fixed and still vibrating and no explanation for how a clamped and secure hose came off the dealers have drank the kool aid and will lie and back up the manufacturer on the record off the record they say the guys in germany are a bunch of jerks who wont listen and treat the mechanics like idiots who cant get it after being out the van so long and having such horrendous support from both the dealers and the manufacturer i would not recommend the van when the first few months of ownership are so bad you would think they would want it off the road and out of your hands so as to not prove just how bad it really is instead they sent me a letter saying they are going to buy it back and then did nothing lawyers have told me they will drag this out as long as they can to save money since their attorneys are staff and they outsource the buyback process to a third party who is commissioned by giving you the lowest price they think they can in other words they are paid to screw you literally google highest award lemon lawsuit in history mercedes or impartial services group    when you sum this up its poorly manufactured and they cant fix the problem even worse is europeans from sprinter chat rooms are contacting me saying they have the same problems and want to know if i found a solution they dont love the natural harmonics answer   worse is the popularity of the ford is killing resale value so i cant even sell it for a fair price and it is a few months old best offer is k less than i paid for it  months old and a k discount pretty sad update k spent and x still not fixed  mercedes sent me a buyout offer of k to go away knowing the new transfer case that should have been put in before the warranty expires was k  the power steering hose is a serious and common problem there is no known cause furthermore many are reporting that biodiesel rots the fuel system and costs k in repairs my first instance of biodiesel in illinois caused sensor failure in the fuel system  that was another three days for repairs and i had to wait a week to get into a dealer since they were so backed up the catalytic converters gum up and go bad and that is another k repair  lots of people pissed about this the antenna has been fixed  times  it is a bad design and a pain in the but to deal with the only tech who seemed to know his stuff in the whole country is a brit who worked on them in the uk he is in colorado and even he could not fix my van completely he fixed two things and something else went wrong the dealer support nationwide is a joke very few trained technicians and lots of people learning on your dime parts take weeks to months to get in and down time is unacceptable i was recently in an accident and while i appreciate walking away from a sub  mile an hour collision the van will be totaled because of the way it was constructed and the cost and lead time on parts after such a terrible ownership experience it is a fitting end do not buy this van especially considering the the  will be a fully new model with a different engine and no carry over meaning they are not investing in improving this model and its parts i can go on and on about how bad this is in reality you can google it the best article yet came from an expeditor company whose ceo bashed the van after years of unacceptable problems failed to get resolved google the fatal flaw of mercedes benz sprinters linked in i had read many negative reviews about the sprinter before i bought it the size and x capabilities made me overlook it it bankrupted my transportation business in  days i
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,amazing to drive  horrific to own i have owned over twenty mercedes and this has been the most exciting to drive and yet the worst for reliability the quality of the cabin components are cheap and tacky and a disgrace to the badge and the electronics are a complete nightmare i cannot trust any of the onboard warning systems and my repair bills to try and get them sorted is like paying off the national debt the depreciation on this vehicle has been alarming and i am so disappointed that this will probably be the last mercedes benz i will purchase
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,sl amg this car is a dream to drive its
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,the feeling of being on train tracks a head turning beauty you will never get tired of saying thank you when hearing others compliment its ego building style
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,known lemon every one of them stay far away mercedes is well aware of all the abc failures on their sls  sls  but are still allowed to sell them in the united states there is a very dangerous problem if you are driving at the time of the failure imagine a shock suddenly coming off a vehicle at  mph not imagine that each and everyone of the vehicle sold that year fail  fail sound like a class action lawsuit you would think so but some how mercedes benz is able to still push lemons out the door this is not just plain greed it is a complete lack of value for human life i have completely lost all respect for mercedes benz
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,oh damn its broke again seems like this car has been in the shop more than it has been on the road the last  years i bought the car  years ago with  miles on it it now has  it has a ton of service records on it if its not the abc going down its the srs system or this week its the sos flashing and then the trunk will not open and now the ac has quit and the shop says its going to be expensive to fix its just one thing after another thinking about parking it in the front yard and filling it with dirt and making it a very expensive planter

Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,no wonder germany lost the war twice run away from mercedes it is a poorly designed car that uses expensive parts of poor quality  this car reminds me of the mid s junk that detroit put out  dumped the car  avoid mercedes and buy an audi ford or anything else
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,not worth the money i was a big fan of mercedes prior to owning my  sl after having it in the shop for now the th time in  months they still cant fix the transmission and excessive oil burn the new transmission slips like youve lost gears until the car is completely warmed up try pulling out into traffic stepping on the gas and the engine revs but the car goes nowhere then out of nowhere  sec later the car catapults you into traffic i was finally told that this is a race car you cant expect it to drive like a luxury car how about that in addition to having to add a quart of oil every  miles mercedes has some work to do before i would ever recommend this car spend elsewhere
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,some disappointments  no regrets the biggest disappointment is with lack of traction  you get on it with traction control off and the tires spin with atc on the car responds by actually coming to a halt right after take off  you nurse the pedal and start wondering if you should have saved a few k and bought a sl the convenience features controls are very inconvenient as one goes through the menues to change settings etc also a few electrical problems with the convenience package drivers seat wont retract on exit  car wont start easily if left parked for  or more days  or  malfunctions convenience functions unavailable is often displayed with no indications of the problem  then corrects itself

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,what would you expect  we all know the mystique behind the name mercedes and its the same mystique that porsche and bmw and now the audis have  engine power and design and the blue print of a car that iswas ahead of its time  my sl is what it was when it was  of the showroom floor an engineering marvel  just as the porsches i have owned if you spent  on an american made car in the mid s the only ones that would be worth a damn today would be the ones never or rarely driven german or japanese and you cannot go wrong  stay away from the audis however they havent figured out the turbo debacle yet
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,worst worst mercedes i ever owned nonstop problems keep coming ive been to  mercedes specialist all the mechanics told me to get rid of this car asap because too many on this model of car its not worth to fix thats why used one is much cheaper than cl
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,v bang for the buck after years of lust for the big mb v i broke down and replaced my c corvette with an ultraclean fully optioned sptdistparkk mi example the car is heavy which adds to a solid feel allaround but you wouldnt notice it with power that is immediate and omnipresent i looked at other newused cars in the class but none of them could match the looks price power and features  just ask yourself where else can i get a v k car for  the original price not ferrari or bentley mercedes went all out on their flagship model with plenty of wood and leather to match the techno gadets that are loaded with car the jury is still out on reliabilitymaintainability
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,driving and tech showcase unbelievable combination of performance build quality and style unlike other german cars this one really has flair and more just a grudging acknowledgment that style needs to be there as well coming out of jaguars this has been the only mb in quite a while that could actually be termed sensuous performance is truly iron fist in velvet glove  unassuming but very big performance envelope when called upon
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,blackjava cl  replacing passenger door electric
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,"amazingly unreliable mb has sometime in the last few years lost its commitment to quality control and reliable design problems in first  days picked it up on a friday afternoon  returned it immediately the brake lights didnt function picked it up on tuesday returned it later the same day when it exhibited a disturbing vibration at highway speed poorly aligned drive shaftnext drive showed the car handled extremely poorly mb dilivered the car with a cheap set of tires not suitably rated a few mornings later with only  miles on the vehicle the car was totally dead in my garage the dealer claims it was only a bad battery"
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,what i think while there isnt much visual differences between the cl the  stands alone when it comes to power the hp is almost too much for the rear wheels i wish it had all wheel drive and was about lbs lighter and was truly stand out that this vehicle cost close to k i was tempted to leave the window sticker permanently in the window i also wish mb would not have put a governor on the vehicle it tops out at  where it still has plenty of room to stretch out to the  mark i admit i dont feel  safe driving at the mid triple mark speeds bc it is close to k lbs and would hate to have to try to stop or make a swerve if cash is tight go buy a bmw
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,mb cl has been a very good vehicle very few things have gone wrong w cara difficult car to break into  years ago we had a breakin attempt where the perpetrator broke all four side windows and the rear window  despite this they where still unable to enter the vehicleas all the windows are double pane  laminated
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,dangerous car i own a cl and recently had a total brake failure i hit a wall doing about mph no airbag deployment presafe brake failed and no warning about the brakes mercedes lawyered up and refuses to deal with this ive had lots of other little problems but am shocked at how they treat customers buying a flagship model
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,lemon dont buy in the last  months i had
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,it tickles me it still continues to exceed my performance expectations and in my estimation is a stronger beefier design than the  model change
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"caveat emptor  let the buyer beware my cl was one of the worst driving experiences i have ever had previously owned  mbs i purchased from a mercedes dealer a  model with  miles  big mistake there were major problems with the cd player the instrument panel the windows the headlights the nav system and the pneumatic doors  i finally gave up after driving the car  miles and taking it to dealers  times for repairs receiving no real assistance or compensation for my inconvenience from park place motors dallasone time they paid for a rent car or mercedesbenz of note when i traded park place mercedesbenzmidcities where i had purchased the carwould not even submit a bid for the trade"
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"disappointed owner  visits for repair most on computer issues  suspension failure if the car was reliable it would be my favorite car of all types i have owned there appears to be no end to the computer issues with this car"
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,what a car driven the cl amg for a friend and it
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"my benz it is a bit uncomfortable to get in and out of the rear seats but hey i drive not ride  i love the car  i am still working on all the toys as mercedes are not known for their toys  i am trying to det the dvd to show a picture"
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,amg only i just want a cl amgthats it
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,"front end trouble the vehicle was my dream car  the exterior style and interior were immaculate i have had two problems the high performance low profile michelin tires suffer from slow leaks and make the car ride rough  i have taken it back to the dealer  times thus far for wheel alignments and the front end vibration shakeat speeds above  mph persists  the dealer states there is nothing they can do about it  i am disappointed"
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,electronics problems on cl abc failt twice
Mercedes-Benz,, cl amg
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,lets be objective i knew what i was buying before i bought it  this vehicle does get terrible gas mileage compared to a civic but you should expect it when you are buying an almost  ton truck that costs   it is stiff but you have to consider what this truck was originally desinged for  i had to take it to the dealer to have a few minor things fixed but what vehicle does not have problems every now and then  the verdict is this  if you want a vehicle that will never go out of style that will take you virtually anywhere a vehicle that has plenty of power and eye appeal then you should buy one  if you are thinking why would i need a truck to be all thati dont knowwhy not
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,"its a truck  not a luxury suv i bought this vehicle in spite of your review  i wanted a stiff rding ruggedly built durable vehicle with a military heritage  you may nitpick but its still an sclass interior  it cant go out of style because it never was in style  it will out climb an h and do  on the road  try that with any other suv on the market  yeah youll be laughing in years to come but it will be at yourselves for identifying this thing as a luxury suv"
Mercedes-Benz,,g is tops ive owned several mercedes benz but by
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,"not all that i admit i had to order one and be one of the first yes i made a mistake and will be selling or trading it in while its a respectable off road vehicle and can run circles around anything except a hummer either one but its just too goofy to be seen in every day face it call it retro art or just plain ugly its not a good looking vehicle interior quality is mercedes all the way not sure who this truck is targeted toward but its not me"
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,what a mistake never again
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,ugly nice inside bad outside
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,bullet proof i like this truck in every way
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,buy anything but this car is horrible from the day i
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,unsafe at any speed i had a problem with the so called
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,"tough truck this is a great car for trips down the trail or cruising at  take your pick  not very nimble but if that is what you were expecting then you bought the wrong car  tows well and with ease and absolutely refuses to get stuck  gets aot of looks"
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"problems galore have had numerous electical and mechanical problems  the vehicle has been in the shop  times in  months  the g handles extremely poorly  after the fact i have also found out that a roof rack of any type is not allowed by the manufacturer something they dont tell you when you purchase the vehicle"
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,update to previous review ive had this vehicle now for  months it has been in the shop several times it is not reliable and i cannot recommend it the steering wheel shock absorber was replaced and front end was aligned the entire headlight bulb assembly had to be reworked to fix an electrical short this took  trips to the dealer and the passenger side door had to be realigned since it would not close properly this was all within the st week of ownership then the rear door lock went and now the rear window washer does not work car is a time bomb the dealer is now offering to buy it back after my complaints it was supposed to be cpod but problems since day  have been occurring
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,infamous g wagon looks great very macho vehicle driving was a different story steering was numb ergonomics were dated uncomfortable seating position for long trips
Mercedes-Benz,,maximus
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,porsche to g wagon robust is not the word to describe this steel frame heavy steel massive hinges youd think it was built for military use it turns heads everywhere  ive been wanting one for  years and am not in any way disapointed except i wish service could be thru mb trucks and not the car dealer
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,gwagon this truck can go anywhere and through anything it can also tow my  foot boat without a thought i also like the fact that it is solid and not made of plastic it is made to go  miles
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,"silver monster we love our silver monster its like a bad tempered pet"
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,"g this is the ultimate suv it knocks the socks off the range rover and the x performancewise theres nothing like it on the road and definitely nothing like it off road"
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,da bomb its greatfun and u can trust on to get
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"g at  mi  mosold love it the feel and its looks and the attention it gets wanted a vehicle for longevitty had an oil leak that  times at the dealer to tighten a fitting and a broken door latch within  mi sqeeks like crazy enough to make you go mad selling dealer was real lame about fixing anything but another dealer has helped a lot the sqeeks seem to be temp sensitive still keep a can of silicone handy  still feels like a million breaking nice at oooomi"
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"get something else instead it seems like a cool and flashy truck well it is but nothing we have had this truck for over a year and it has been in for service nearly  times they are finally giving us another problems with rattling electrical brakes and other randow things make this one of the worst vehicles you can buy having owned a range rover hse before i wish i still had it i also have mercedes s and that has some issues as well i would suggest staying away from mercedes for a while"
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,bad news this vehicle as a lot of power
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,"pirus for  dlls you expect something not as delicate the tire replacement cover is very delicate alone is worth about  dllsfor that money the car should take care of me not the other way around"
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,"wish i had bought the range rover very disappointed drive is rough for around town and while it probably does great off road it is a bit expensive and dressed up for off road use fuel economy is poor the navigation system is poorly done all in all it is a very expensive novelty this seems to be born out in the unbelievalby poor resale value i would and have not recommended it to anyone else"
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,"not for the mediocre if other suvs promise the moon this onegives you the sun wowunstoppablethis is definitely theultimate in suv comfort the gclass hasa firm feel to it yet does not give up atruly comfortable ride and still letsyou know that youre not sliding alongin some sedan"
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,do it if you can
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,bought cls  just bought used cls  a few weeks ago with k miles and am not super impressed sbc breaking unit needs replacement apparently all units are under  year warranty sadly i am  weeks too late i called mercedes dealer north houston they declined to replace called corporate  they just gave me that long story that they take time to evaluate each request evaluate customer loyalty etc and in the end also declined replacing the unit it appears sbc unit was broken for years and previous owner didnt even know that mercedes has any warranty for them further i am noticing that the transmission gears are starting to slip nd and i think th up and down shiftadditionally have to spend  on minor maintenance things and another  on additional non maintenance repairsleather preserved very well except the front seat has one seem separated for  inches fixabletires are starting to wear out on the inside but it doesnt seem due to alignment looks like another expansive but unidentified problempros looks great black paint preserved very well
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,cls amg mercedes hit a bulls eye with this car it is a userfriendly bad boy  its fun to drive an never lets you forget that you are in an amazing blend of raw power and forgiving state of the art engineering
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior, irritating things but i love the car side mirrors are tiny very difficult to see ride is too mushy even on sport mode setting glare on interior windshield on passenger side from wood trim is distracting i plan to keep the car for  years found out that i cannot obtain an extended warranty since i am not the original owner so now aaa gets my business and i can take it to the mb dealer wake up daimler  if youre over  you sit in the front seats in the rear seat your head touches the roof believe me the  version looks more aggressive so after  years ill get one at less than half cost this car depreciates  in less than  years
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,so disappointed i fell in love with this car the minute i walked into the mercedes showroom i was planning on purchasing a bmw  series but was persuaded by the sheer breathtaking beauty of the cls worst decision of my life the wheels have had to be repaired  times due to potholes per mercedes the problem is in the suspension which cannot even handle a small bump in the road i have had to replace the tires at  miles due to potholes per mercedes purchasing this car is like dating the prom queen which is exhilirating in the beginning but soon you realize she will only drain your pocketbook  do not buy this car
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,lexus vs cls  pros head turner good handling cons quality of lexus ls far exceeds than this one  poor controls interface very bad service by mercedes a bit uncomfortable for longer drives
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,cls   needless to say it gets a lot of attention it is a lot of fun to drive i moved away from mercedes a few years back due to quality i went to lexus and i was so bored this car is anything but boring it is a fun drivers car it reminds you of the joy you felt when you first got behind the wheel im just hoping that the quality is in this car
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,blind spots  i have driven this car  miles from springfield mo to mcallen tx and noticed many blind spots around the car that could cause me or my wife to have a car accident door jams are too wideand windows are too small and narrow overall the car has poor visibility from the inside the right hand mirror is obscured about one quarter by the passenger door jam
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,cls in capri blue the car handles like a dream and has plenty of pep with optional braking and ride styles  abundant leg room for those of us with sore knees that need to be straight for a while  the rear seat is a little tight but not so uncomfortable for a medium distance ride
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style, mercedes cls the style is nice  the car is in the shop at least once every  months fixes so far include oil leaks belt tensioner replaced chrome trim tarnished and replaced differential replaced steering wheel leather peeled door glass window needed several repairs cup holder chrome peels off in one year or so replaced once and will need replacement again window class catches the rubber molding when opened on all doors no fix available at dealer  the car has clicking noise from from and rear suspension the dealer said it is normal to have the noise it may well be normal but i did not expect a mb to have such noises blind spot is bad
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,shockingly underwhelmed ive owned  vehicles over the last  years and the cls is unquestionably the biggest disappointment bottom line  ive got an  luxury vehicle with all the bells and whistles that drives like a  fiat despite being in the shop  times in the first  days the vehicle continues to violently rattle and vibrate the premium sound system sounds like a transistor radio and the climate controlled seats are nothing more than a weak fan with an imperceptable effect two thumbs down
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,purchase mistake to mention only the most salient pointsvisibility for making a left turn is downright dangerous because of the limited viewthe sport or comfort choice has no noticeable differenceno place to leave sunglasses for easy accessbattery had to be replaced after  milesdrivers arm rest had to be replaced after  years  milesthe navigation screen tilt invites the sunshine which blinds the screenseat upholstery is hard and causes pain to a user after a half hourrear view camera has a fisheye undesirable lensa highly questionable technology when turning off the monitor it turns off everything such as the telephone etcwhen starting the engine it roars like a lion for several minutesi dont like the car and am deeply disappointed in its convolutedin the dashboard located information systemsyou need to crawl under dashport to find various switchesleft turn visibiity impossible dangerousi would never purchase this car againamen    except for exterior design the is the worst car i have ever owned
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,ride quality i test drove a  cls matic with k on the clock i was not impressed by the ride quality at all i expected the air ride to be more comfortable i felt every crack in the road and the road noise was bad the tires were new with plenty of tread i will stick with my  audi s prestige much smoother ride and less road noisealso the the head room was terrible even in the driver seat and im  footmy  door s has much more head room
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,chinese parts just had  essential relays replaced all from chinathe car has been in the mb shop for two weeks now trying to find other problemsnever had a brand new car not startthis problem has brought to light that mb probably has chinese parts splattered all overso why does this car cost so muchgermans think they can out engineer bad partshardlyi will not but another mbover priced for cheap parts  and they still fail no matter how well the design
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,worst car  in  years this car has been an ongoing nightmare since i have purchased it   the transmission has failed three times along with many electronics engine components water pump oil pump suspension three times shocks twice buttons switches wheel bearings etc  this is nowhere near the build quality of any prior merceds i have owned the tow truck has been such a regular to my street that the neighbors already know him my kids scream when i attempt to dive it to take one of our other cars as they re scared to be in it and will break down again   this is the last mercedes i will ever own the mechanic at mercdes even told me that the cars are just terrible in the last few years  stay far away
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,unreliable s purchased this car  years ago the car was a  with k miles after only  years of driving this used car the transmission tanked just shut down i was told by the mechanic at the dealer that a part inside was broken and it would cost  to fix i thought i was gettinga bargain purchasing this car for  with only k miles what a mistake prior to the transmission going the car randomly drops the left side suspension apparently the air shocks deflate overnight or while parked for a long time and it tilts to one side gas guzzler too costs me  a week to fill it up
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,mercedes does not stand behind product  mercedes with  miles and has had all recommended service performed at the suggested mileage including regular oil changes every  miles synthetic oilcar stalled without warningtowed to park place mercedes where it was diagnosed that pistons in cylinders  and  had come apart requiring a complete engine block replacementthe cost of repair was quoted at  the value of the car prior to the catastrophic event as listed on kelley blue book is  private salemy expectation is that an engine on a wellmaintained vehicle should last beyond  miles unless there are issues with quality of parts used or the quality of the engine construction
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance, r unfortunate disaster k miles i bought this car certified and have had problem after problem beginning with a water issue that caused electrical problems which despite the knowledge of this problem mercedes didnt want to admit it existed they never fully addressed the problem until my warranty coverage was up then they insisted we put the k claim through my insurance a few months later i had to spend  more to fix a rear suspension problemnow  days later im looking at  for a differential i havent even touched on the problems with the steering column or the window switches that dont work because the entire panel simply fell out of the drivers side door one day
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,faulty cam gears  repair bill to replace faulty cam gearsthe metal that the cam gears were made of is too softyou will have problem in or around  miles and mb will not help you with it other then taking your this is the worst vehicle i have ever owned in my  years of car ownership
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,r engine problems not many potential buyers know that the r with the v engine has a faulty balancing camshaft gear that is prone to failure the gear is failing impacting the timing of the engine in order to repair it the entire engine needs to be taken out of the car and apart cost over  all v mand v m engines between   and   have the potential problem that results in the extensive repairs mb usa is not honoring the repairs and there is a class action complaint in process think twice about buying a used mercedes benz you may be for a  surprise even if the car has  miles on it
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,airmatic suspension failure i bought this vehicle new and within weeks of purchase it began displaying a warning light relating to the suspension system  i have had suspension problems over and over again with this vehicle  i had it at the mercedes service center four times  in less than  months this summereach time was due to a suspension problem  i called mercedes usa to no avail  they would promise a remedy but fail to follow through  i will not purchase another mercedes because in my experience the company does not stand behind defective products
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,not reliable the interior set up with  separate captains seats fit our family perfectly so we almost had to get this car  unfortunately weve been underwhelmed by the performance of this car  the gears downshift suddenly with a clunk when coasting downhill  the steering is gummy  weve had this car in the dealership shop average every other month for mysterious problems like a chirping noise from the engine when idling a recurring rubbing sensation from the bottom of the car when driving mph a somewhat loud vibrating noise when coasting mph on fwy the auto back hatch is slow the nav toggle is hard to use if the economy wasnt so bad wed get rid of this car in a heartbeat
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,do not buy an r we purchased our car used from a mercedes dealer it has been in the shop  times in  months tail lamps melted rear hatch locked shut air vents all broke temperature controls were stuck on a temperature could not change plastic on seat rails has broken multiple times bad wheel bearing rattled catalytic converter broken latch over spare tire misc trim pieces needed to be realigned we loved the car initially but after  months of loaners for a week at a time in some cases we have vowed to never buy another mercedes we have had several mercedes prior to this one and this car has been a major dissappointment i would encourage anyone not to buy this car do your homework
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,deceptive for hauling i had leased the r and took it home  only then did we find out that the third row seats did not fold flat or out of the way  when folded the seat becomes perpendicular to the back and sits  inches from the second row  if you are packing for a trip you lose a tremendous amount of volumetric space  this was never shown and makes it an unrealistic car for trips to the beach  poor design  ended up taking the car back and getting suv
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,great car but often broken we ordered this car new and love it however we feel compelled to get rid of it before the warranty is over to summarize the ills  the car has spent more than  weeks in the shop over  years  fist the battery was changed  times due to faulty computer module this model had to be changed  times  the engine oil pan leaked at  miles and they had to pull the trans to fix that a wheel bearing failed brake rotors had to be change and now the engine is in limp mode and we dont know why  routine maintenance is very expensive  at  miles
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,mercedes r the mercedes r is the worst car ever visibility is poor but the car is very stable driving at high speedsi purchased an extended warranty thinking that i was going to keep the car but i am rushing to get rid of itthe car only has  miles but have replaced the battery three times due to a faulty computer and front shock   miles and the other front shock   mileseach shock is  dollars no mechanic want to touch it
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,the reign of diesels there is some turbo lag until rpms transmission shifts sluggishly when using comfort mode sport mode is a notable improvement  past rpm the r diesel launches into a breath depriving shove it will surprise nearby motorists ftlbs does make a difference try test driving the v gas version see for yourself suspension and handling is typical mbenz firm but no a racer transmission shifter takes a while to get used to tried it on cold icy highway conditions computer stability and traction programs do work in a very subtle way
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,poor warranty from mercedes benz who would ever think you would need to replace a bumper seal my r apparently did and mb will not cover it poor craftsmanship i say the seal went causing rain water to run into the seal and in the trunk where the computer is causing it to short out now i am stuck with a  repair billmy first and last mercedes since they will not cover such a repair its not like a wear and tear item that i should have replaced not to mention the other  times it was towed in for electrical and computer issues leaving my wife and kids stranded on the highwaymercedes benz very poor warranty choice
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,the money pit worst car i have ever owned
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,"solid convertable at any speed i have now had this car two years very few issues solid car with the hard top convertable up or down blast to drive plenty of power in the slk"

Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,mechanical nightmare ok the car looks sexy and when it isnt in the shop it can be fun to drive only  months old im already in the market for a new car the car has been in the shop seven times already it blows tremendous amounts of smoke when its cold and shakes violently when starting up it leaks water from the roof there is a constant whining noise on the passenger side mirror which im told is pretty typical new tires needed after  miles paint job is spotted in places looks like they missed  spots  lost display lights while driving and remove key light stayed on for days be careful very low front easily damaged unfortunately its not worth the money very disappointed with car
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,dont get it dont get it if you dont like attention this car is a looker and youll get random people approaching you giving you compliments unlike others i like the sound of the stock sound system whats ridiculous though is that in  it still wont play mps the airscarf is a musthave option get it or regret it
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,my new slk everything is perfect about the car except the stupid cupholder design  one tiny bump in the road and your drink drips  down the center control panel  also i should have waited for the model with the heat scarf and better stereo system  after market mercedes did not wire the glove box to add a changer and the base stereo package does not come with rear speakers just dummy speaker covers which makes the sound thin  drives greatlove it otherwise
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,slk  never driven in snow or salt as i dont know how well it would do new rear tires had a nail in oneservice maintained by mercedes dealer in gainesville fl love how the hard top automatically folds down into the back bought the car as it was the show car on the floor in two different mercedes delerships not  sure of the color may be a custom colordark silver with a hint of dark blue car is washedwaxed and babied on a regular basis never driven on poor road conditions  pot holes dirt roads and the like
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,mb quality overstated quality overpriced car dishonest dealers and poor customer service all the way up the chain unusually high number of defects for any car
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,ford  well i have always wanted one of these
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,car needs work car is not reliable  third trip to
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance, slk drives and handles extremely well and
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior, slk have had the car  months now and it is
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value, mercedes benz slk have been waiting years to buy one
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,dont buy one this car is smoke and mirrors its slow uncomfortable gets poor gas mileage and is over priced  paid k for a auto and have to tolerate  dummy phone switches because the car does not have bluetooth  honestly research bmw saab audi before buying this make  id return the car tomorrow if i could  everyday i walk to this vehicle and wonder why i paid so much for a car with so little  mercedes benz must be making about  grand profit on each of these very very average cars
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,horrible quality  always being repaired i purchases a new slk  and started having problems with it within the first  miles the oil sensor was faulty and then after being in the shop  days i got the car back and the  sensor receiver went bad  then electronics module went bad twice crank shaft sensor went bad car stopped because of electrical bug and had to be towed steering wheel spring sensor went bad navigation system had to be replaced  dont buy this car as the reliability is horrible this car is constantly in for service
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,should be sent to the scrap pile the car is obviously poorly engineered i can only say that this is the worst underperforming car you could waste money on save your cash and buy a real exotic cause this aint it k and the transmission had to be replaced the engine knocks like an amc pacer on unleaded gas burns oil like the forgot to install the rings i will never own another mb after this beast is put to pasture oh mb has denied that they are replacing  engines like there is no tomorrow so much for dr z and his nonsense he should make the remaining payments the car is listed at  hp no way it develops  more like  maybe my z could blow the paint of this beer can
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,used slk  i just recently purchased this car
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,awsome i just traded in my  slk  for a
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,it was a fun experience i totaled my slk  when i broadsided a huge suv  i loved that little car  its solidly built heavy engine saved my life  i paid cash for the car in  and im really disappointed at how much it had depreciated over the years  it did not hold its value well at all  my biggest complaint was with the interior around the gear shift  the coating flaked off and was unsightly  ive noticed this in other slk vehicles  i didnt leave my car in the sun so you cant blame the environment  on a long trip its not comfortable
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,"i never smiled so much have been in market for a convertible for about a year and found this one at a carmax in may   after driving bmws the honda  nissans z etc i found the car of my dreams  unbelievable performance ride handling and the clincher was the retractable hardtop  never in my life have i driven a car that keeps me smiling every second behind the wheel  yes this gem only will be on the road on sunny weekend days but wowits unbelievable"
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,"very disappointed i have had my slk for  months  first  uneventful  likes  love the body style and the retractable hardtop  little road noise  car handles well and is relatively comfortable  even on trips for several hours  dislikes i now live at the mercedes service department  have had bad alternator two separate tail light failures leather flakes off door handles and center console repairs on the roof and numerous other minor problems  all of these have been repaired under warranty  so just the inconvenience  overall i am very disappointed with the quality of this car  i expected more from mercedes and will not be a repeat customer"
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,slkamg   when i was looking at cars i knew i wanted a convertible  while the cost and performance of the corvette was interesting you see a boatload of corvettes on the road and i wanted something a little different    it finally came down to a choice between the lexus sc great companysmooth quiet reliable car and also a hardtop convertable vs the slk  amg  if i had chosen using my head i would have gone with the lexus  the slk had the performance and looks but questionable reliability  my heart won the battle  so far i have not been disappointed
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,slk amg i have throughly enjoyed my driving experience so far  it hugs the road and actually feels like a real sports car  i am not a mercedes fan but this car won me over  i actually chose it over several other cars with much higher price tags  my one complaint is the awkward placement of the cup holders  other than that get the factory installed radar dectector youre going to need it
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,nice body style terrible engineering this was my dream car when it came out i immediately traded in my bmw z for this slk donkey it was the worst decision of my life the car does draw attention if that is what you are into the car spent more time in the shop than on the road replaced a manual transmission at k and now needs another the engine acts as if it does not get enough air and strains in the lower power curve the car is a  reliability nightmare and does not perform like it has  hp closer to  hp mercedes has consistently failed to stand behind the car and has denied there are issues even when they have released multiple internal documents on its poor performance last mb i will ever own
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,slk hottie we are returning owners of mbz  we
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,terrible investment this car sucksi would never get another mbmy convertible roof doesnt work the dashboard is falling apart i lost the drivers side mirror the windshield is cracked  its a  with k miles on itim looking to get rid of it and get something more reliable especially since i was told by mb that it would cost approx k to replace my drivers mirror
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,watch the roof on this car i have had this car for approximately months now and im a bit disappointed i have to say this car doesnt get as many looks as the z that my sister owns i thought the roof was one of the great things about this car until i started having trouble with it about a week after i bought it and the dealer doesnt want to fix it its going to cost me  just to get the roof working and  to fix a balljoint for as expensive as it was when it was new i dont think it should have these problems already with only  miles on it but i have to say i do like driving it when its not in the shop i just have to be careful when the sun goes down the top doesnt come up out of the trunk
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"take it from medont buy one if you dont like going to the dealer every rd day for fixing dont buy one"

Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,mercedes benz a complete waste of money first off i call myself upgrading from a  lexus gs but soon found out that i actually downgraded myself in this german problem the air conditioner failed  times  one time it failed as soon as i picked the car up from being serviced the brakes are an ongoing problem  they dont last more than  months and the brake dust that accumulates on my wheels in the course of  day after cleaning them is completely out of control the fit and finish with the car is horrible the interior door handle is peeling on both doors bulbs constantly go out the dashboard illumination is failing which means no clock etc my advice get a lexus  when my lease expires i certainly will
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel, e well recognized and respected vehicle
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,the worst benz ever made this car is the worst peice of junk
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,bad buy i bought the first edition e  yrs
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,"wanders on the road car will hold a straight line i have to constantly move the steering wheel to keep it between the lines i have not driven drunk in  years but i could hold a straight line in my old ford drunk than i can the e  sober i am very disappointed"
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,take this car and after  months of driving this car and at least  trips to the dealer for repairs for electrical leaks etc in the last  months i am going to sell it and get another lexus the electrics are horrible and it takes  weeks to get the gaskets from germany for the oil leaks buyer beware
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,disappointing ive always wanted a mercedes to me they were the epitome of luxury cars im sorry to say i have been terribly disappointed for what i paid i expected a top of the line vehicle but got far less than i could have gotten from a new camry to start with the navigation system is very important to me yet the e has no touch screen no voice command not even blue tooth some japanese economy cars have blue tooth in fact the processor is so slow it cant present but a few streets at a time and has no readable compass in the nav mode no right arm rest for the driver if you use the cup holder i could go on but space is limited i wish i hadnt given up my camry for this car
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,after four months of driving i dearly love the car if i can keep it out of the shop  it is the small things like keyless go has given me fits three service visits now the steering wheel up and down module is out  hours of labor  other small things have gone out i love the power the economy of fuel sirius radio gps and comfort but overall quality stinks
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,frustrated long time mb owner three major problems resulting in overnite service emergency brake release came completely out of dashboard could not move vehicle harness for seatbags defective and had to be replaced starter key went dead after  mi could not reset clock for daylight time nor could three dealer service personnel confusing option sets on steering wheel etc etc
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,e  class by itseslf   we drove alot of cars and the way a this e drives continues to impress  not the fastest car mind you thats the  but driveability of this car is in a class by itself
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,never will buy any mercedes benz everagain
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,mercedes does not stand behind their products its a great car but this year model has too many problems mercedes does not stand behind their cars i had to replace the balance shaft which cost me  because mercedes made a design flaw they eventually had a class action law suite succeed but they refused to fix my car there was also a recall on the brake pump  again they refused to honor the recall saying they could not get the correct code   year later i had a catastrophic brake failure on the high way  again they refused to fix it even though there was a recall i called mercedes headquarters in new jersey they again refused to honor there recall i am very disappointed in mercedes benz it appears all they want is your money but do not stand behind there products
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,bad transmission for  matic my  is currently under mb manufactures warrantee and i have been fighting with mb to replace my faulty transmissionat  mph it skipsmb tells me there is nothing wrong and this is normal performancei am filing complaints with every agencyi paid an extra k for my extended warrantee when i bought my certified used mb and mb will not fix thisi would never buy this car
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,oil pump problems listen in the morning at start up for a whining noise it is the oil pump because very few mechanics change the front of the trans oil there are two oil plug for the transmission mercedes will replace the oil pump even the vehicle is out of warranty because they know there is a problem   and  e
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,speed transmission problems ive owned  mbs in the last  years theyve all been reliable cars last year i purchased a cpo  e with  mi and an extended warranty  thank god i purchased the warranty  within six months a major oil leak had to be repaired on the engine and an interior trim piece on the center console pealed off not so bad two days ago i was driving and the transmission bumped hard down shifting from nd to st gear  when i drove off it would not shift out of st gear  had it towed to my dealer  they called today and said there was dark foreign fluid in the transmission fluid that an interior part had failed and the transmission would need to be rebuilt or replaced not amused
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,the last days of mercedes the e is chintzy  it manfiests the dreadful consequences of the abominable decision mb made in the early s consciously to debase the quality of the fine automobiles on whose splendid engineering and construction mbs centuryold reputation had been built  those of us who knew the quality that once epitomized mb can tell the difference with but a moments inpsection  the car has  batteries to support needless electronic junk one battery has already failed  there is a bicycle spare tire  the barely used radio produces an echo sounding like crows cawing in the background  just touching the bumper to a sleeping cat can cost   the mercedes benz we knew belongs to the ages
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,got transmission i am compelled to write a review on this car after a year and a half of ownership because it has been a series of nonstop transmission problems which mercedez cannot seem to fix  i do not know if they have fixed the  model but you really need to thoroughly testdrive this car and ask around also the back tires needed replacement after just  miles which seemed a little too soon  this car also has a totally unusable cup holder something you think is just a small thing but turns out to be huge for us commuters i am thoroughly disappointed in my  purchase and wish i had stayed with a lexus a car i thoroughly enjoyed for ten years
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,mb e sedan turned back from audi to mercedes and i do not regret it i was hunting for the right car for a whilei found it in this mb it is the absolute pleaser in every possible ways ride comfort appearance are all in balance i dont think you could go wrong with this car
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,lover of the benzo know what you want and go for it
Mercedes-Benz,,benz
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,bmw fan get his mercedes ive owned  bmw  series vehicles the last one i had was a i but it rode so badly and had many problems  when i got my new e i was really surprised i got the sport package which stiffens the ride a bit but not as harsh as the bmw ive only had it for a week or so but fuel economy is good not great and the handling is stupendous for a benz i only hope i dont have problems with this e as i see many people have had some problems but cant be as bad as the bmwi
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,nothing but problems i purchased this car in october  its now june th  my car is currently in the mb service dept  it has been there this time so far  days  the car has been back to service dept at least  times since i have gotten the car  had to be towed once  there is some kind of a major issue with this car that they are unable to figure out  since i got the car when i put it in reverse to back out of my parking spot it sounds like metal is being torn apart  each time the replace things thinking they resolved the problem  i get the car back and a day or  later it all starts again  not only that but each time they find something else wrong with the car   this is unbelievable that a car of this expense has caused me nothing but aggravation every time i get in it
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,my lousy benz the brakes screech badly  the blower motor had to be replaced the windows dont work properly and the engine is loud   i thought i was purchasing a quality vehicle   guess not
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,missing my  e this is my th mercedes and th e class  the  e is nothing like my previous es  i have had electrical problems brake problems keyless go issues and the command center freezes up  when the command center freezes all features of the car are inoperablethe nav phone radio etc  the dealership has had the car multiple times and can not seem to get everything repaired  the command center just went blank today on the way to the office today  also be prepared to hear squeaks and buzzes from the dash and doors  the dealership has been able to remedy some of them  please dont make the same mistake i did and get wowed by the technology  the controls are difficult to figure out and require multiple actions for simple adjustments  lastly the four cylinder is not appropriate for a car of this caliber  drive it for a long time before deciding
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,whats happen to mercedes quality took procession of our  e after turning in our  e    e seem like an improvement over the e as we drove off the dealer lot we had a check engine light turns out it was a bad oxygen sensor we also had a rattle in the dashboard that had to be fixed drove for another  miles and windshield wiper motor needed replaced never work drove another  miles and the passenger set has an air leak from massage system this is crazy
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,comand system much too complicated i have had several mercedes prior to this one i loved my e and leased the e when that lease was up i am completely disappointed with the entertainment system i am somewhat of a techie so i usually enjoy playing with complicated systems not this one i dropped sirius and signed up for the internet hotspot figuring that i would use iheartradio instead big mistake the car kept losing the internet signal connected no internet even though i was in densely populated and internet active parts of the northeast it took too many scrolls and pushes to get a radio station  forget about changing stations even as the passenger changing between cell phones for bluetooth is another disaster  everything takes multiple swipes scrolls etc ridiculous im dumping the internet hotspot and signing up again for sirius because it is the lesser of two evils even playing amazon music from my cell phone via bluetooth requires too much work its a shame i just leased a gla much less expensive starter suv for my mother and the entertainment package there is much simpler and much more basic the good news is that both the driver and passenger can use it without thinking that they will cause a crash when my lease is up in  years im not sure whether i will lease another mb if the comand package remains as complicated  and dangerous  as it is now the rest of the car is fine and lives up to the standards i expect from mb the entertainment system however is a huge dealkiller
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,noisy and transmission issue cabin has too much engine noise especially during acceleration transmission has  gears when gear changes due going up or down hill you can feel the gear change and sometmes the car jerks
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,avoiding pot holes and manhole covers my wife loves this car and is her main form of transportation   i leased this car primarily because of all the advanced technology and was concerned that maybe there would be lots of maintenance issues  none so far but to my surprise the run flat tire system got my attentionno spare  prior to leasing i drove the car up and down the freeway that was close by and the ride was as expected  i did not look in the trunk and had no idea there wasnt a spare  ive owned es for  years and never was there not a spare  living in san diego county you get used to driving on roads with pot holes and when you hit one with this car it is really jarring and even though the car was probably engineered for these tires there is a marked suspension bounce and a slight bit of skipping if you happen to be in a turn  you feel every bump in the road with the run flats  i also purchased a battery operated tire inflator just in case the pressure ever drops on the tires when im traveling in the hinterland as you are only guaranteed  miles running flat  research indicates you may even have to replace the tire which are very expensive and according to reviews are somewhat hard to find and in worst case you wipe our the rim tooreally expensive   it is very obvious that a lot of effort has been made to reduce the weight of the car by eliminating some enhancements that used to be on the    i have had almost zero maintenance issues in the  miles the car has been driven the only one is that the trunk lid does not spring fully open as it did when new causing a few head bumps   otherwise we are very pleased with this machineplenty of horsepower for us  years and counting  the ambient lighting massaging seats usbphone capability all are very pleasing  wished they had stayed with the same navigation software as the  yes  the seats could be fully covered as before but again that is probably a weight thing   have not yet decided if i would purchase this car primarily due to my issues with the run flats
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,luxury beware of hidden nonsense charges on the final invoice after you cut your deal eg dealer prep advertising etc
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,e was not ready for production bought a  e with p package complaint it is awful its been in the shop  times transmission issues back up camera problems climate control hd radio does not work doors had to be slammed shut home link did not work there is still not a fix for the hd radio it was in the shop for  weeks with no resolve it is back in the shop now for rear view camera intermittently working climate control turning off and again to look at the hd radio the transmission was fixed and the body shop reset the doors on the third try ive asked the dealer to buy it back and they wont  mercedes finally agreed to buy back the car due to its inherent suspension problem  strangely the service records say no problem found
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,if there is a more expensive poc i want to hear the non leather mb faux seats all tear  cushion is  there is an oil leak that happens to all of them from  lies to  cost me  then another less common one i guess that was  i got all my service work at dealer i paid  dollars for it in  and im told my wholesale value is  omg i should have bought another lexus  i have never had an issue with lexus
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,i got a lemon mercedes this is my mercedes car no  leased on  ondrive home from dealership open hood signal was on it took some effort by  people to shut hood next week ac was not working took it to dealership they fixed it some leaky valve i was told on  dead batterycar was towed to dealership on  new battery installed car is still at dealership we are trying to work with them road side service is overloaded with calls asking to call back unless it is an emergency looks like lots of lemons on road one review on carscom is very alarming
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,build to last a real solid car  extremely reliable ive put  in  years and the only thing i am doing is the scheduled maintenace and changed tires once  i will keep untill it falls apart
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,she will be missed sorry to let her go  we are selling this car that we have owned for  years due to downsizing after retirement and relocation  it has given us much pleasure and satisfaction in the years as a daily driver with no problems  one surprise when the battery died it needs two one of which is like a motorcycle battery
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,e review
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,worst time for mercedes i regret to say that this was the worst mercedes i have ever owned it seemed that something went wrong with it every other week the digital readouts on main display failed causing to lose the ability to use particular options hvac system completely failed and needed total replacement window regulator failures side mirror motor failures seat heater failures seat adjustment motor failure trunk release failure fluid leaks engine mounts needed replacement  k miles and many more malfunctions despite this being mercedes nobody should be experiencing this many problems with a car costing this much it is by far the worst car i have ever owned
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,worst car ever bought we have spent over  in the last  months for problems we shouldnt have some repairs started at about  and i mean major repairs  this year front end sensors of all kinds at about  just keeps on cant buy another car for awhile since were retired and the crooks at the feds did a good job of evaporation of our ira our other merc was just fine a  we thought this mercedes would last us awhile
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,love my car when it works do not buy i currently average about yr or month in repairs to drive this car the quality of the parts is shoddy primarily due to poor engineering its not engineered for longevity the bottom line is that the car has way too much electronics that control and monitor everything those electronics do not have the life expectancy of the mechanical parts heres my list of repairs front struts rears are leaking radiator damaged transmission  see tsb control unit for tranny suspension compressor air hoses relating to suspension tires because suspension was messed up what i still need brake accumulator new motor mountsnew tranny or torque converter rear struts
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,junk pretty prestigious totally unreliable we made the mistake of keeping this heap beyond its warranty period at  miles the rear brakes failed  and the sensor for the front brakes failed with  pad wear left we also made the mistake of trying to take it on a trip  car died after  miles had to be towed never own one of these heaps beyond the warranty period all service had been done correctly and on time
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,falling apart we bought this vehicle about  years ago as certified used from dealership  we have been taking it in for repairs about  times a year  head lamps have gone out a few times each  the radio quit working a few months agoreplacement costs   warning lights go on about once a month for coolant level brakes lamps etc once every few months  the transmission is very jerky at low speeds  interior trim pieces and outer roof strip are coming off  the enginetransmission noise while driving is loud and harsh  interior truck lock assembly is falling apart
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,saved my life i purchased a preowned  mercedes benz e from a collegue in april of  it had  miles but it was in great shape save a broken cupholder in august of  while stopped in traffic on the way to cape cod a chevy blazer traveling at approximately  miles an hour stuck the rear of my e i cant really remember it but my car flipped  times landing roof down in the middle of the interstate i should be dead instead i walked out with nothing but a couple of bruised ribs  a new outlook on life look at the negative reviewsall arbitrary complaints about little inconveniences mercedesbenz saved my life the safest car on the road bmw cannot even touch mb safety
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,dissapointed this k car has spent too much time at the dealership for minor repairs i feel high tech has gone too far with this vehicle for example rain sensor windshield wipers automatic seat adjustment these two things have never worked and dealer has not been able to fix oil level too high this keeps appearing as a malfunction on computer screen gas cap has to be frequently repaired winshield wipers make awful scraping noise even when wet dealer also unable to fix very dissapointing auto
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,disappointed e owner i purchased my e in  and drove about  mi my selection was based on appearance test drive competitors and mb reputation so far i was in for  service visits for alarm short stuck gas cap battery short and at least  times for the transmission all of the problems were addressed except for the transmission in low speeds the car bucks and the transmission hangs up between gears according to the dealer who was generally helpful mb headquarters do not recognize a transmission problem as it is not a safety issue basically they do not know how to fix it i guess that in germany where they drive a stick they do not care about us cars my first auto a  tempest with  speed transaxle had a smoother transmission
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,"will never buy mb again mbgerman lemon first and last mb i will ever buy since i bought the car i noticed that the car pulls hard to the right its like mb built the car crooked whats even worse is that mb tried to make me pay for alignmentservice has been poor and nd rate compared to infiniti  lexus even after alignment car still pulls to right cd player failed  times battery was replaced left speaker fell off gas mileage not as great as advertised climate control failed car is too heavy for the engine especially when accelerating from a stop  transmission jerks when shifting from st to nd at slow traffic speeds amazing how a g engine is less refined than a g honda"

Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,this should not happen to mercedes  e bluetec v diesel nothing major but bunch of small stuff that disables car for days cracked intercooler hoses failed mass air flow sensors failed egr valve clogged dpf filter scary one was when fuel filter clamp failed sprayed fuel on hot turbocharger and ignited my lucky day i was standing in traffic  so i was able to see cloud of the smoke coming under the hood and can of soda put the fire out i should let it burn  all this under k miles this is my th mercedes and seams that newer the car more problems with it

Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,tricky cars parts are very expensive check carfax and maintenance records or you will regret buying an used car edmunds sucks on costumer service they never send me the  dollar visa card for using edmunds never replied to my emails or phone calls
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,shame on you mercedes  e this is my second mercedes and my last transmission went into limp mode at k miles called mb headquarters and was told that there had not been enough reports of this issue for mb to recall hard to believe because its being reported all over the net the local mb certified mechanic says he cant get the repair part because mb has a lock on them i see  models driving all over but  are not even making it to k i was told that the speed sensor fails around k miles where is the quality  the car is doa in the driveway while i drive my jaguar go figure

Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,poor quality car died at k milesi have had three mercedes and all of them have had severe quality issuenever buying a mercedes again
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,pushing your luck only the merc themselves and people who drive their cars know how terrible their cars are engineering dependability luxury performance are at its worst compared to lexus or bmw spending a fortune on a car like this is totally not worth it
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,e awl break dust is too excessive windows need to be tinted somewhat side mirrors should  automaticaly close when car is turned off considering the cost of the car back seat is too small although there are  headrests it really is not comfortable for  adults  headrest adjustments on the passenger seat fails to perform
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,less than expected after an initial week in the shop for a faulty headlight and electrical faults very dissappointed  the vehicle is bearish unrefined and very uncomfortable even for a sports car  mb tried to produce a refined sports sedan but sadly accomplished a choppy ill mannered and very uncomfortable luxury sedan with lots of horse and foot pounds and no way to fully enjoy the performance of such  steering is numb and ride is harsh noisy and busy  in comfort mode acceleration has an off putting lag  performance seats are hard and uncomfortable   i expected much more for this price
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,leased  e conv leased this vehicle and this will be my fourth mercedes and it has been in service four times within one month and a half so help at all neither a call from mbusa
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,warning bad engineering ahead after five long years of owning my  e td i am left with a completely destroyed car due to poor engineering on mbz turns out mbz designed the transmission cooler inside the radiator the tranny cooler contains oil and the radiator contains water think about it yup the two mixed last weekend and water went into the transmission completely destroying the transmission torque converter and engine electronics leaving me with a k bill for a car worth only k last summer it was k to replace the diesel injectors the summer before that  to replace the ac unit and belts the car only has k miles on it it is now scrap metal unreal

Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,disappointed wish i hadnt bought it check engine light came on after  miles struts had to be replaced after  miles suspension still a problem navigation system is a disaster seat controls not working properly after  months and  miles i am considering getting a new car i wish i had not bought this car
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,overall not too bad this was my first benz when i bought back in  it did pretty well for the first year but then the car started to have numerous problems the wind sheild wiper stopped working the cd player broke and still is broken today and some various other things seemed to not work the way they should after a while we ended up spending about  overall in the past  years however im not really the kind of person that treats their car like a baby or even owns a garage i also ignore regular servicing a lot after we got all this fixed though the car seemed to really work well and has continued to do so so far im not totally sure id buy another merc but id definitely buy another german car
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,electrical nightmare the car has been fine except for the electrical system which has had problems off and on for my entire ownership of it the latest issue is the electrical failing after a car wash no lights turn indicator etc scary and the dealership can never figure out what is wrong also the navigation system is quite poor and antiquated i would honestly never ever buy another mercedes benz
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,luxuryvalue luxury value
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,hard to replace this is my second new mb but not my last  in ten years i replaced normal wear items consistent with the mileage but not much else  service at the dealer is somewhat expensive and i had one bad experience of being overcharged which i complained about to the next few service advisers  they agreed and made things right oddly in the last couple of years the cost of replacing typical wearable items has gone down  generally less than estimated  the car gets  mpg running around and about  mph on the highway at about  mph  the car still looks great rides well and is totally reliable which makes it difficult to drop k to replace it with a new model
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,glad its gone just traded my  e m with  kms for a  lexus gs i bought the e with  kms on it and a vibration cropped up between  kmph and kmph daily until it warmed up not tires but a known problem with mb and they say it cant be fixed at london on mb also  front fenders rusting through along with bottom of the doorsmy problem not mbs and various suspension issues cd changer and audio system was all fuzzy sounding and the drivers chair creaked like an old lazyboy service got expensive and it was just time to let it go it was disappointing because we thought we would have many years of service from this car but we became afraid that it would end up being worthless
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance, e sedan this is worst car i have ever owned every time i turn around something is wrong either with the electrical system ac engine overheating or the windows wont go up oh and of course the cylinders keep going out the check engine came on once again today two out of six cylinders are not working i need another full time job to keep the car on the road not mention the  oil changes i wish i had my infiniti i back it never left me on the side of the road
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,whats with the rust buyer beware buy something else anything but this car when i bought the car it had a couple of spots where the paint had bubbled up since then the car has been rusting worst than a tin can even though ive been keeping it in the garage mercedes refused to address problem yr mile nonsense  body work also paid  to replace airbag sensor in front passenger seat dealer claims it happened because a heavy person sat in the car whats up with that spent  on rear window actuator dealer said because i dont open that window very often the glass got stuck to the rim oh yeah one of the catalytic converters was replaced too
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,e series matic  logical choice in snow looking for a awd ematic is the only awd in a sedan that glides through snow like hot knife in butter its quiet responsive and luxurious i wish i had heated seats but for the money i can add seat heaters for a couple of hundred dollars  the nav is a bit awkward but does work as expected
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,the worst car ever ive owned this car for almost a year and it is horrible  my  lexus sc with k is better made and more reliable than my mercedes  mass air sensor went without any warning air conditioning is terrible and makes noise display on radio is distorted  parts are way too expensive and car is very unreliable anyone considering a benz i would strongly recommend a lexus  toyota puts out a much better product at a better price with better quality
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,good car but the am radio has never worked well i replaced the cd changer in the trunk after three years and limited use interior vanity failed third year variuous other little problems that required trips to the dealer like lights air conditioning and power steering thank god for the extended warranty but this excluded radio vanity light and cd player my wife loves the ride i expected a lot more for the money im disappointed
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,reliable so far i have had no problems  i bought it used from an authorized mb dealer so i have the starmark warranty and a bit of factory warranty left  i have not encountered any problems other than regular maintenance repair  i probably could have bought one for about k less from a non mb dealer but i did not want to risk dealing with headaches
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,"expensive with chrysler quality i have owned this car for just under  years next week it goes back in again for service i have a total of  defectives more than  other cars combined over  years i think mercedes has recreated the electrical system problems that jaguar was known for in the past this car needs to be sold before the warranty ends my impression is mercedes does not care"
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,"mercedes price chrylser quality so far weve had to replace two radios fix squeaks and rattles in the dash driver sear and trunk speedometer broke digital information screen went out and  power side mirrors quit  dealer service is terrible  buy a lexus"
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,perfection is a must have first benz no other auto comes close so its been one after another every  years hate to give this one up though thrilling ride maybe a
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,st year in the shop over  months i have had a bmw lexus and really liked the  eso i purchased a cpo oneand that is where the nightmare beganthe navigation system randomly freezes the stereo systemphone system is on but no soundmb says its the softwarehmmm but cannot be the hw according them themthe rear bumper was literally not fitting in properlythey said that happenswow okthe rear passenger door was not aligned with the carthey said that happens with timethe window would open on its ownthey replaced the window and saidits fixedbut it was not they finally changed the motor and now its fixed worst experience i can imagineperhaps a yugo would be better
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,exetremely disappointing the front brakes had to be replaced at k milesat k miles the back brakes had to be replacedprior to this i drove a lexus for k miles before the brakes needed to be replacedwe will be going back to lexus and i hope i never live long enough that i am forced to purchase another mercedesbenzdealers have only been marginally helpful and say this is reasonable wear  might be but isnt for a lexus
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,the worst car i have owned to the point i am a professional driverdriving instructor have owned too many cars to countmostly high performance porsches bmws audisbought this vehicle for size to transport my baby gandchildren in k miles had to have the front brakesrotors replaced  timessticking throttle never repaired very unsafe numerous electonics failuresover  times in the shop unable to repair the vehicle properly including the sticking throttle when i requested a trade assist for another model mb corp refusedadvised thats whet the warranty is for obviously will never own another mb
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,abs pump noise issues the car is nice but for over k mb should do something about the noise from the abs pump  the car cant tell when is out of control and every time you take a curve it activates the abs pump for the stabilizer unit  bad design
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,mechanical mess we have now had our new e sport sedan back at the dealer for the fourth time to fix a srs malfunction  in total the car has been in the shop about three weeks  totally unacceptable and hardly what we expected from a mb
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,ticky tack ii followup to initial review since then have been on a long trip  averages  mpg  interstate speed however latch that opens center console simply fell off  part is on back order a problem   this is in addition to garage door opener buttons receded into mirror and windshield wipers being installed backwards  also there is a recall for loose bolts on underbody pan that reduces road noise i wonder if bmw is having issues
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,poor tires overall this is a wonderful automobilemy th e class sedan however i have had a very bad experience with the continental tires supplied in this sport model i had  blowouts and a bubble in the sidewall of a third tire in  months of ownership  total miles i admit that driving in the northeast with potholes is stressful on the tires but i have never had a blowout before i suspect that these tires have a weak sidewall continental  and mercedes customer relations have been no helpi would recommend the luxury version with the smaller wheels in areas of the country with uneven roads
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,ticky tack bought car and afterward had knee surgery  only  mi ive put on car but garage door opening buttons on rear view mirror receded and unit had to be replaced  rained on way to dealer and had clickingsticking noise from wipers fix  they had been installed backwards  have replaced air filters wkn going on long trip and soon and hope to see improvement on gas mileage
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,not as good as advertised the mb television ads for the th generation e class said they put everything the knew into this car  they must have lost a lot of knowledge dealing with chrysler  the car is sluggish the transmission shifts to slowly for the paddle shifters to be of any use the exterior design looks stolen from the accord sonata and genesis  i bot the car  weeks ago have about  miles on it and already  trips to the dealer for fixes not what i expected at all  i also didnt expect such poor gas mileage  when i got  with my lexus  v the mbtex seats are horrible leather covering should be standard as should tilting  fold in outside rear view mirrors e is overrated alot
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,blind side assist do not waste your money on this option it does not workmercedes new this because they put in their manual a warning about what this option would not do the buyer does not get a chance to read the manual before buyingit says speeds exceeding your vehicle speed will not be detected it also says it will only detect  feet off of your rear bumper i know for a fact it will not pickup  sometimes this thing could get someone killed if they dont read the manual before trying to use the alert the front head restraints will not go all the way downtalked to dealer they said that is the way it was designed they are other small items that needs to be corrected
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,e coupe
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel, e review
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,disappointed the navigation system is overly complicated and inaccurate  the voice control doesnt recognize anything properly youll find yourself relying on your phone  the acceleration is sluggish and lags horribly unless you engage sport mode  clumbsy having to reach for sport switch all the time
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,my new benz check package  car was to have this package lane tracking package blind spot assist and lane keeping assist
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,air conditioning issue driving me crazy i bought my  e after looking at several luxury makes  the ride comfort and features of the car were far superior to any others in its price class  however an issue with the air conditioning has made owning this vehicle extremely frustrating and unhappy about my decision to  purchase a mercedes along with frustration and anger at their response  heres the issue im having  with no pattern rhyme or reason and with no warning the two air vents on either side of the steering wheel stop blowing cold air and bring in hot recirculated air for about  seconds  its a noticeable sensation and very unpleasant especially when driving in degree heat  ive brought the car to the dealership three times leaving it there for a week at a time and they say they have been unable to duplicate the issue  since this occurs on a nonregular basis obviously theyre not driving it enough to have it occur when theyre driving it  i finally contacted mercedesbenz usa and got this explanation from the rep  if the dealership cant find a problem then your vehicle is operating the way it was engineered to do  please dont insult my intelligence and tell me that a  vehicle is supposed to have the air conditioning blow hot air through the drivers side vents whenever it chooses  i am going to give them one more chance this week  supposedly a technical specialist is coming to look at it  and then im going to file a claim under the florida lemon law  this may be an unusual issue but there needs to be a resolution  which in my opinion is either fix my vehicle correctly or give me a purchase credit minus the miles ive driven it for a new vehicle  what was supposed to be a pleasurable experience in my mercedes has turned into a big problem  if anyone else out there has had this issue please post about it  thank you
Mercedes-Benz,,mercedes e
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,smart and sporty car everything is fine except for blind spots  even with blind spot assist it is hard to see on the sides vehicles approaching as the doors are set higher than usual and mirrors are a bit smaller   the driver seat is set too low does not raise or tilt backwards far enough to see the road better  interior room is about the same as new cclass but center console on cclass is set too high limiting the space for the arms  just a few bugs
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,bad wheel quality on mb e we bought one certified preowned  e at mb encino california on  only drive about one month and  miles there is a front tire pressure problem that was caused by a crack inside of the wheel rim we drive this new car very carefully never hit anything since there is no damage on the outside wheel also how to we hit or damage inside of the wheel that is a  parts quality problem mbs warranty should cover it but they dont please think about mbs wheel quality before you plan to purchase a mb since we found couple cases report about it already also mbs customer service is not friendly do not answer customer phone call and do not care customer concern
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,navigation and service false promises from sales and service i always keep a  garmin gps with me never wanna depend on mb nav system im scared it will take me into a deep ocean one day entire car good but nav make it worst experience
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,hopeless mercedes benz never buy a mercedes unless you want to overpay for a completely unreliable vehicle buying one is like losing money and keeping one is like throwing good money after bad i bought a brand new  e six months of ownership and  problems  trips to the shop  tow  battery rechargeand worse of all tons of aggravation and frustration dealing with  mercedes benz
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,this was a lemon right from the purchase this was a problem car the entire fuel system  diesel  had to be replaced a warranty item then the front ball joints had to be replaced this happened twice this vehicle had fancy seat controls all of which failed brakes were bad and had to be fixed the fuel injectors  diesel  failed and required three replacements yes the almighty mercedes benz can still makes lemons and i met people who had similar issues
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,my final benz i have had  new cars in my life and  mbs before this clearly this is the worst car ever owned and the worst benz  when it wasnt in the shop or on the back of a truck headed to the shop  which happened every  months or less  it was excellent  the dealer tried to help but he couldnt make a silk purse out of this sows ear  hopefully i can dump it before a potential buyer finds that it is a consumer reports used car to avoid  mb has produced a real disaster and was totally unwilling to even discuss assisting me with my problems beyond the now expired warranty  maybe its time to return to japanese quality  quality cars which have never let me downleft me stranded
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,by jim s the turbodiesel has all the response and acceleration of my previous  e on trips i typically get around mpg if i keep the speed   or less  i have experiened  mpg over a  mile stretch
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,the mb from the moment i drove my e class
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,cdi this is the finest mb  what a car
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,bad decision from start to finish i purchased a certified preowned  e from a very reputable mercedes dealership in north carolina  it was the worst decision i have ever made  i fell in love with the appearance of the car the dynamic italian leather seats navigation etc  unfortunately it doesnt run properly  in addition to regularly scheduled maintenance the mercedes service department at two separate dealerships has had my car in for repair eighteen times in two years no joke  it has a stalling issue that mercedes trained and qualified service technicians cannot fix  it supposedly does not generate any error codes when it does this so mercedes cant fix it and im stuck with it  beware
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,beware of certified preowned i lost a bmw  in an accident and needed a car found this sharp platinum blue  parchment e with chrome wheels after one week the brake problems started ive had the car a year and the break problems went away for one week when something else broke i took it in to have the other problem fixed and the brakes were bad again the certified warranty is up and so is my luck ill not only never buy from this dealer but wont buy a benz again
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,never again the quality of these cars is not better than a ford for  i would have expected this car to be in the same league as a bmw or lexus and its not
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,stay away from the airmatic suspension with  miles on my new e class a red message came on the dash do not drivestop the car now the airmatic suspension failed and the car looked like a low rider i had the car towed and four days later it was repaired the control module failed along with a few other things this module is approx   what a nice thought down the road the brake pedal squeaked the door trim is a light color with no door sill so it is always dirty replaced once the wipers were noisy and chatter and mercedes doesnt seem to know what to do  i had to put white lithium grease on them to stop the squeak noticed this when i went to pick up the car after four days in the shop stay away from mb
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,e class repeater this is my second e class and im spoiled rotten when you compare price vs features and quality on other cars the base e class is a terrific value turning circle comparable to my kids jeep wrangler
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,the finest car built the e is the finest touring
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,disappointing quality my th mb diesel   bought new and kept almost  yrs the  the only disappointing one a pleasure to drive but very disappointing quality rust repainted a few times by mb but it is back  years laterand many electric and various problems that just should never have happened wheel bearings generator mirrors cd changer lampsockets sliding roof airconditiong etc for the money we spend every year with mb toronto on maintenance incidentally excellent service pricey but no hassles  i could lease another car
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,rust have taken great care of this car only has  miles and the body is starting to rust really bad this car has been washed and not in michigan winters but for only about  years i have been told that this happens allot because of the poor quality of the steel they used in  is anyone else having some of the same problems what is mercedes doing to help repair these cars rust problems
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,last of the bank vault benzs i know my mbs trust me on this the  e class is by far the best years of the e class do not buy a  or newer i have k on mine paint is starting to fade a bit a little rattle in the cat conv other than that it drives and runs like new chrysler ruined the name from  to like  or roughly around there they tried to infuse their technology into the e class at this time and failed miserably a  e class is a k car with a mb star on the hood the  is heavy solid and feels german its a little underpowered and dont buy a matic if you are worried about gas if you value your familys safety want to to stay out of trouble and want to look cool buy a
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,bad car i bought this car my first mercedes and while driving down the road with the family the front drivers side coil spring came flying out this also caused the ball joint and the tie rod to give up the ghost asked mercedes for help with the bill  and got a resounding no seems like this should be a recall and or mercedes would live up to the mechanical default without me having to hire a lawyer wont own another i will but something that doesnt self destruct while im driving down the road
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,below average quality automobile i have owned my e since new years in that period of time i have spent an average  a month on routine service and an average of  per month on repairs repairs like  window regulators rear differential seals recall item cd player went south after  years leaky transmission plug replaced twice right and left  sensors vibration damper recall airflow sensor broken front coil spring crankshaft sensor entire rear tail lamp assembly i have  miles on it granted a few but i dont expect repairs like from mb i have owned a number of other autos and have not replaced anything like the things i replacedrepaired on this auto
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,too expensive to maintain i have never written a review on a car until this one  it has been soo expensive to repair i felt i had to warn people not to buy the car  the rear windows use some sort of plastic strap to make them go up and down and they dry rot  they have broken  times in my ownership and it cost  each  service is  every  miles  every time you bring it in for service there is something new that will cost you another   the most recent issue is they said the rubber boots around my axles are cracking and they want  to fix it  thats right not that the axles are out just the boots and it is going to be   i am buying a lexus or acura next
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,hunk of junk looks pretty but everything around the engine has fallen off or broken  the repair costs have been outrageous a real nightmare of a car stay clear of it
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,the everything vehicle this vehicle satisfies the following
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,"glitches this is a fabuluos reliable car  its glitches are that it goes through lights quite often and the heating thermostat is never very good  you never know when your heater will freeze you or roast you  when its really cold the heater is weak  von housen becomes less interested in your car care as the car ages"
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,"its a great car when it starts we purchased this car used with  miles on it  after  days the right rear window motor went out  chching and then about a month later we noticed the ac wasnt working very well  chching and now the stupid car takes  or  hits to start  and i know this will be the macdaddy chching  i dread it  am currently searching for a trade deal so i can unload this pos on some other sucker  if you are thinking about buying mercedes think it over carefully and then shoot yourself in the foot if you decide to go through with it  get it over with"
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,amr changed the electric window motors for
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,what quality purchased vehicle as a starmark pre
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance, miles later  our  e matic is still running like a champ no significant mechanical issues and the car has never left us stranded we keep it in the garage our  glk gets the carport parking and keep up on all the maintenance religiously
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,does not live up to its name this is a great car when it works but we have had tons of suspension braking and electrical problems fixing anything costs at least an arm and a leg this is my very last benz german engineering just means expensive to fix
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,"presets in steering wheel i cannot believe the idiots at the top of mercedes they made a decision that someone should be fired forthe comfort steering wheel is anything but that the sterio arrows in steering wheel just scan the stations and do not skip to your presets as they shouldthe dealer said they changed this for this years model  are they nutsim so upset that i spent k  i also have to hold the preset for memorie seating too instead of a one touch like the caddys really silly stuff that could have been great shame to the executives making bone head decisions"
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,faulty electrical the car has been in the service department to replace control unit for radio  problem continued and another electrical part was the problem cost to repair is excessive also the remote door locks failed and a sensor for hood latch failed  fun car to drive when it it not in repair shop
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,beautiful but fragile i have owned several mercedes during my life time and i can telll you this has been my worst experience with mb three blown tires broken a arms broken subframe bransmission issues and not to mentioned expensive parts and repair costs this vehicle was made to be driven on air not on realistic day to day roads i will not recommend this vehicle very beautiful but fragile
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,bad air conditioning system the air conditioner continues giving out foul sour acidic smell even after  heater core replaced  complete cleaning the manufacturer call center confirmed its a known issue transmission adapter failed once and is now leaking agin  independent service center called it a fire hazard does anyone experience the same as i do with this car please let me know  i really appreciate it
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,never buy another one mercedes has lost its quality of years past  i purchased my e and for two years had nothing but problems with it  after  miles and   in repairs i traded it in for a lexus
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,worst vehicle   after owning lexus and bmw i was excited when mb offered the e  matic  this vehicle has been nothing but a disappointment  the transmission is not smooth and overrevs at times there is a delay when starting to accelerate that is unpredictable and dangerous  the braking system is noisy and very hard to adapt to in order to come to a smooth stop the ac system is a joke when it starts to run on hot day it revs so loud people outside the vehicle stare thinking something is wrong  i have had this car back to the dealer numerous times and i am always told that is just the way the car is  i would never recommend this vehicle
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,over priced hunk of junk warning to other potential buyers been through  recalls on the sbc brakes and other electrical problems this lousy vehicle needed a wheel alignment at only  miles and the warranty only cover the labor and not parts and guess what parts costs over  to set the steering straight pretty pathetic for a pampered vehicle that is only driven on the weekends
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,electrical nightmare car has been and electrical and mechanical nightmare dealer had car for almost  months trying to fix charging problem software upgrades and failures galore the dealer has been fine but the overall quaility is terrible i have owned mercedes for over  years and this thing is a lemon
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,benz in trouble the e class although elegant beautifull and world class has been very disappointing reliability simply stinks performance is unpredictible and truck like at times this is the ematic with the adjustableadaptive suspension that is at the sport ii mode is worse than my replaced acura mdx  comfort is subjective however the level of noise inside the car is a ford f on a train crossing the hydro nonsense brakes are the worst ive had on a car unpredictible you simply do not have a clue everytime you want to stop how much pressure you should be applying the car sticker is grand that is the problem for that much cash every  car in its class is a better one

Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,mb does not live up to its reputation i have waited for almost a year to write a review on my  e with sport package in order to live with the car for a while and not make any hasty judgements  i have always wanted an e  and i regret to say that i am very disappointed  first i would like to say that the car does not exhibit the solidity that mbs are known for my car has many creaks and rattles from the extensive plastic parts used in the interior  the standard seats are firm but extremely uncomfortable more uncomfortable than any car i have ever owned and i have owned over  new cars since i have been driving  the sport suspension is overly harsh  all in all very sad for a car costing   beware of mbstill cant wait for the lease to be over  ill never buy or lease another mercedes product
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,stay away from mb long time mb owner this e has had issues from when we drove it off the lot the worst issue is the terrible transmission shifting which is a safety issue when driving at highway speeds there is an intermittent problem with a long hesitation when you step on the gas to pass or avoid something and the car accelerating the premium leather seats they are not standard and are not on most cars sold are very uncomfortable because they pivot above the base so if you dive in any position other than a right angle the bottom of the seat back pushes into the small of your back our brand new car had loose parts and noises which were corrected but is that what you expect from this car
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,beware mercedes doesnt have parts for this car i purchased my brand new  e in may  unfortunately someone rear ended it two weeks later it has been over  months and mercedes is unable to replace the rear bumper on my car they cannot give me an answer to when they will have the part i did not expect this from mercedes beware people before you buy mercedes are they going bankrupt
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance, e is junk i bought this car new in  and it is one of the worst cars i ever purchased it gave me lot of grief and frankly i wouldnt have been as disappointed if it had the chrysler logo instead its motor had to be changed twice all window motors broke down speed sensor gave up ac didnt work shock absorbers crumbled into pieces and more  all in first  years frankly i and some of my friends gave up buying merc in favor of bmw the car has only k miles but it is a hunk of junk and been a lemon i have a  inch thick file with notes and problems that mercedes had to fix stay away from mercedes if you want peace in your life
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,severely disappointed bought this car used from the original owner in  with only  miles on it and thought what could go wrong with such low mileage  plus my intention was to only drive this car to and from work which averages about  milesyear  well first the electrical wires to the drivers side front headlights kept coming lose which cost  to fix  then the ac went out along with oil leakage and transmission problems which totaled to   i wish i have stayed with buying toyota or subaru which are far more reliable
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,whats wrong with the  mercedes  i enjoy my car on the highway but in the city the gas mileage is terrible  the car is designed so that the heat only comes in from the sides and not from the front which makes it cold in the winter the center dash contains the windows buttons and trunk buttons and will short out if you have spillage the leather is not the best either  it is hard  in addition the car is hard to drive since it is only power assisted  there is only a cassette in the car the styling is beautiful  it looks very much like some of the newer cars i purchased it used with  thousand miles
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,stay away purchased in march of  w miles on it now i have  on it only got stranded once out of town you better have some deep pockets for this bad boy  on suspension just for the front driver side and the passenger is going any minute leaked oil rapidly since day one put oil in like buying gas lights always need replaced at  a pop need radiator  need tierods  once the body starts to rust goodbye got my money worth by using it for work if not for that would be angry plus this model looks so outdated since new models have came out got me a  bmw i and it runs circles around this car in every category go bmw if you got this car sell it now today
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,bad car for very high price car had problems all after warantty period horn stopped  outside mirror broke  left rear window fell down for no reason  head gasket blewvery common on these cars  complained to dealer and mercedes and got nothing will never buy another
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,i expected more from benz bought this  e used in early   i now have  miles on it  engine remains reliable but thats about it  my entire instrument panel is not functioning dealer replaced ignition switch which did nothing ac died  years ago dealer replaced dash heating unit which did nothing car is rusting badly
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,"the worst my husband and i purchased this car fromour niece who was transferred to hongkong we didnt even get it home beforewe started having problems the frontend needed repairs twice electrical andwiring several times  batteries thealternator the air conditioning forthe three years we have owned thisvehicle we have paid out nearly for repairs it is by far the worst carwe have ever owned"
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,big german disappointment my th benz will be my last ok styling
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,"ughfirst and last mercedes for me love the power of my  e but hate the fact that every little electronic part is failing the ecu  the little fan over the mirror  the seat adjustment working backwards  the ignition key cylinder  the mirror control  the stupid cup holder  going on sale this week"
Mercedes-Benz,Design/Style,mbz and i like it i bought this car from san ramon german
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,long legged tourer even  years and k this car looks
Mercedes-Benz,,none none
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,k mile lease with only k miles if i can attach a picture i will show how my petite  pound wife has to use two seat cushions as the car kills your back oh and if you are under mileage mb financial just says nothing
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,worst car ever the first week the horn stopped working  while in the shop car would not start  car has been in and out of the dealership at least  times because it refuses to start  very undependable  worst mercedes weve ever had  terrible car and no assistance from mercedes
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,a disappointing experience this car has a really significant blind spot caused by the width of the strut between the front and rear doors and the wing mirror is small  my model has the blind spot assist feature which i find to be unreliable to the point of being dangerous
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,return mb buyer
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,i hate fake leather for this amount of money fake leather is annoying also i know i live in tx but why is it so difficult to find a dark leather interior i have dogs and teenagers light colored interiors are difficult to keep clean and light pleather doesnt clean well at all so damned difficult to find
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,wheel spin torque steer and bluetooth disconnect i got this car from sixt rental car in san francisco and spent the week with it  i really wanted to like this car but every time you accelerate even lightly the wheels want to spin or you get torque steer around a turn  the engine is peppy but not so much that it should be spinning one of the front wheels  this car only had k miles on it so it was pretty new  the interior was nice although the seats were pretty firm for a small suv  the ride was firm but this doesnt other me because i like sporty cars  the other annoying thing about the car is that my bluetooth kept disconnecting randomly while on phone calls  i have an iphone s plus so there is no reason for this and it does not happen in other carsi think i would have given this car  stars if i had the all wheel drive version  i would not recommend the front wheel drive version
Mercedes-Benz,Price/Value,fast pricey its fast in a straight line not to shabby in the corners very very small i really want to get it out on the track ill update then
Mercedes-Benz,Engine/Performance,eye candy  but rough ride pros sporty style very comfortable front seats fantastic engine poweracceleration easy set cruise control above average fuel economy  cons terrible road noise very bumpy ride almost to the point that you feel no shock cushioning poor weather stripping allows excessive amount of rainmoisturedirt around interior door casing bring towels to the car wash awkward door lock handle interferes with elbow room small window makes reaching atm and drive thru difficult without hitting your head very expensive run flat tires uncomfortable rear seats  this is my first mb and i expected much more of a smooth and quiet ride
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,electronics are ridiculous i have had the car for  months on a lease  the car has  been in the shop a whopping  times for the same problem   the keyless go  i have had issues with the car trunk opening without unlocking the car the blue tooth sounds a little grainy im told the door unlock from the handle works intermittently and then just recently had a bizarre message about security on my radio and that i had to call customer service to get it unlocked  i was also told not to put my key in the  console as that messes with the electronics  are you kidding me
Mercedes-Benz,Mileage/Fuel,not thrilled generally this car is just basic nothing too exciting the eco drive feature is dangerous and unusable in the city it frequently just revs when the accelerator is depressed in the eco mode until suddenly the accelerator kicks in i have narrowly missed being in several accidents and no longer use eco ever in general the car does not have much punch accelerates slowly we previously had a bmw  i know apples and oranges still its disappointing finally the headrests on the front seats are poorly designed i am  an average height for women and the headrest is too high in its lowest setting i have developed chronic neck pain from these seatsit is easy to park in the city especially with the rear cameras i do wish it had keyless entry for safety reasons and its cliche but there really is nowhere to put a purse the console between the front seats has the dial to control the functions panel and it frequently gets bumped by my purse arm etc suddenly changing functions such as radio station etc
Mercedes-Benz,Comfort/Interior,pull the trigger my wife and i  looked at a lot of suvs and cars before buying our gla it wasnt the cheapest or the most spacious but what its defidtly not is the same boring car or gas guzzling monster suv you see everywhere  its a head turner and it shares the same heritage as the most exspensive mercedes  if you listen to all the rhetoric from every critic on the net youll never feel secure buying anything you wont be disappointed if you buy one
Mercedes-Benz,Service/Maintenance,front cv joint problem i bought this gla   matic on septemberth    it was my dream to own a mercedez  but unfortunately the next day after delivery of this vehicle i found noice in the front axil while i turn the vehicle to left or right sidei took the vehicle back to the seller and they found that the front axil is defective they ordered for replacement  but i dont know how long will it take to get them heremy question is how could the one of top rated mercedez cold deliver such defective vehicles out of factory i am really disappointed so my advise to new buyers of this vehicle is that  please double check the axil before you take the delivery of this vehicle otherwise you may not notice the problem until the the warranty is over i didnt even drive  km after purchase i live in british virgin islands carribbeanupdate after  months they replaced the cv joint but still giving the same problem took back the car to the service  they ordered anot her set  months now still no word from the company waiting patiently for the part to arrivevery much disappointed
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,love the look hate the car ride is stiff rattles my dentures no room in the rear im a big guy so this has made my car a three seater not enough space between brake and accelerator my foot often is partially on both which is a hazard waiting to happen the gas mileage  sucks im only getting  mpg well below the advertised amount this was my dream car since the fx first came out my dream has turned into a nightmare
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,ralph performs well but no telescoping steering wheel is a problem with long legs
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,"luxury refined i have owned  cars in the last  years accord camry mazda  etc i should have started with the i and saved a lot of money"
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,"infiniti i dealer service poor to lousynissaninfiniti customer service does not return phone calls from owner or dealer service managers"
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,"very unhappy customer infinity should be embarassed to sell this car especially touted as luxury the ridehandling is so poor it borders dangerous the roadwind noise is so high that one does not want to drive the heat fan is extremely noisy i used to own  and  maximas the interior design in many respects is the same extremely disappointed will not approach infinity again"
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,horrible money pit purchased this car with  miles on it and odometer now reads  since that time check engine light came on needed to replace radiator it cracked temperature gauge it broke left rear brake caliper it seized suspension is the worst pretty much intolerable the engine has the most obnoxious clunking i have ever heard was recently told the muffler and catalytic converter will need to be replaced asap as these do not pass inspection this car is a money pit when it comes to gas and repairs and the performance is disgraceful for the infiniti name will be purchasing a hondaacura and will never consider a nissaninfiniti in the future
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,infiniti fan this is a terrific car  bought it used  years ago and havent had one speck of trouble   highly recommend this vehicle to anyone
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,unreliable thought it would be a reliable car but has been problems since i bought it only k and it smokes like crazy dealer says this is normal and has had transmission problems
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,"very not impressive this car hasnt impressive quality that infiniti has been advertizing i have driven for one year and had so many problems with several rattles wind noise cocked steering wheel outofround tires bad compassand even bad dealership services we are thinking about selling this mess off"
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,i love my i i chose this car when i had to replace my acura integra with a larger mommy car i initially went for one of the new acuras but decided on this car after comparing prices and test driving them all more than  times each this car is sooo comfortable especially on long rides i havent had any major problems but i am disappointed that the drivers seat motor went out one thing the turning radius is horrible
INFINITI,Price/Value,external noise ive had the i for the past  years i could hear external noise like wind when driving at  mph  i also have a camry for a comparison purpose and hence will go for a lexus next time
INFINITI,Design/Style,gcpthp this car takes off like a bat from hell
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,"cant go wrong with infiniti very solid car  im short so rear view is more difficult compared to my old g  ride is comfortable"
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,"luxury with some sport my i reminds me of driving a bigblock american v  when you want to gofaster just put your foot down  it hasplenty of luxury features but twoserious flaws  the ride quality is poorand the turning radius  feet makesit hard to manuver in tight spaces"
INFINITI,Price/Value,"questionable vehicle for the price i find the ride unresponsive too much play in the wheel  why is a hp vehicle have fron wheel drive  it feels weird  headlights come on automatically too soon"
INFINITI,Design/Style,infiniti m  for  tire rotation every  miles  a bad design i recently purchased an infiniti m and like the car i was in for service today and told i have to pay  for tire rotation every  miles because the sensors have to be recalibrated in order for the tire gauge on dash to work that means i would have to pay nearly  before i get a new set of tires they do not tell you this when you buy a car this is a bad design for a luxury car and undermines the marketing effort of the company to consumers i have had  bmws and nothing like that this is nickel and diming the consumer in the service department bad news if i find this with other services i am going back to bmw they cover your service including tire rotatio
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,m techonology package i purchased my m in april   because i felt the technology package would make my driving safer and i have been very happyon long trips i feel comfortable that my car will slow down and speed up depending on the car in front of mei have had problems with the cruse control cutting off when driving into direct sunlightthe land departure feature is wonderful as is the blind spot warningi never again want to drive a car without these featuresi have not experienced a problem with acceleration as described by others
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,audio failure my first infiniti msdriven  milesaudio started failingshuts itself down every now and thenbrought it in and received a g loaner they replaced the whole system still the same problem and worse navigation voice guide doesnt work anymorewith new system lost all my recorded cds thats taken outso need to redo all thatxm charges extra for changing into a different radio id as they call itso have to pay out of pocket to fix itand still awaiting more parts for trial and error repairacceleration lag gets worse after  miles and nothing they can do about thatgoing on a roadtrip this weekend and had to drive this without audioregret buying
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,disappointing performance too often when i step on the gas hard i get a long lag before the car accelerates  when that happens it feels like  hp not  hp  other times its fine but i cant rely on adequate acceleration to move quickly onto to the highway or to pass cars  when i slow down the transmission jerks as it downshifts and sometimes unexpectedly actually upshifts jerking the car forward  infiniti service said that there was nothing they could do  the car was designed this way
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,fix  navigation and bluetooth this is an updated review had to pick up my daughter in the bronx from englewood nj at  am her car battery died my navigation got me to her location no problem but directions to go home which is only around  miles routed me over  miles out of my way i am unfortunately not very familiar with the bronx and this was quite stressful at this hour in the morning bad directions are routine with this vehicle and bluetooth remains practically unusable because no one can hear me well im told there is too much echo
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,ipod owners beware if you are an ipod user and have current software  and higher forget about synching it infiniti cant figure it out and corporate customer service just shrugs its shoulders pretty disappointing and pathetic i assume same is true with iphones
INFINITI,Price/Value,outrageous i have a g and a g sedan now this m is liquid platinum i have driven the bmw  and  and  convt the mercedes sc and ethe jaguar xf the lexus  and l this car is heads and tails above them for about k
INFINITI,Design/Style,raditor this car is weak in radiator sistem i dont know what the engineering was thinking when they put the ac hoses attach to the radiator you have to drain all the coolant to fix thr problem
INFINITI,Price/Value,fun but not reliable i bought my ex about a year ago and got a steal on it  i saved tons of money and got the name infiniti to go with it although it has left me stranded two times where it will not start roadside assistance has towed it to the dealer where the battery was replaced once and today they have no idea what is wrong something is draining the battery my first infiniti and my last my honda never left me stranded in  years this one twice in a year very disappointed in this cars reliability great low price but not at the expense of being stranded with a little one
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,noise the biggest complaint i have for this car is the highpitch noise every time the car starts and accelerates this is a pretty common problem according to online forums infiniti hasnt fixed it and not one of the service mechanics have heard it i like to drive without the radio but thats not a possibility because of the noise i am considering trading in this car for the  buick enclave
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,disappointed i bought this car in june with high expectations  i have been sorely disappointed   most recently with  miles on the car the battery died  the seat warmers also did not work  when they were fixed the heat was so low that i could often not even tell the warmers were on  the storage space is really limited and the gas mileage is worse than expected  infiniti is also a pain to deal witheven as my car was in the shop with problems infiniti was more focused on selling me another car than solving my issues  what i like is the styling engine power and cool features like the rear facing camera  but i really had much higher expectations for this car  not recommended
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,love the car but it has warts i have owned the ex for  months it has k miles on it have had no significant service issues with the car i like the overall driving experience of the car handles like a sports sedan vs an suv looks are subjective but it has grown on me the car has developed annoying interior squeaks and rattles dealer cannot locate them  the car gets horrible mileage like avg of   ive never cracked  mpg in  months  with the cost of premium fuel this is a serious deficiency of the car  imho its not due to my driving style had i known of this mileage issue i would not have purchased the ex sorry infiniti  i like it  i dont love it
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,disappointed after researching for over a year i finally chose the premium pkg awd in canada  to my surprise the door seals on all the doors came off the doors within an hour and i later found that two cups of coffee do not fit in the cup holders  who would manufacture a vehicle like that  needless to say i am disappointed in this luxury vehicle
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,still a few kinks to work out i have had my ex for  months  i was told by the infiniti dealer that the car could run on regular gas and that is what i have run  i traded a g which i only put premium in for  years  i have had no problems with the car running on regular and was told it would not void my warranty
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,tech heaven or tech hell on paper this is a car from heaven for tech geeks  harddrive rips and stores your cds flash card reader for music voice activated phone and navigation intelligent cruise control lanedeparture warning and prevention cam virtual overhead parking image etc  imagine having all that in your new car and then not being able to use it  infinitis legal department has really gone overboard in limiting what you can do with your tech if you are not stopped  example  want to find a restaurant  you can only choose from the four nearest even if  are behind you  even the music system is restricted when youre driving  insane  really really frustrating
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,looks nice but many faults we hated this car so much that we returned it  months before the end of our lease and paid thousands just to be rid of itthe car looks great but driving is a choresteering requires effort engine noise will wake the deadeveryone thought the car had an exhaust leaktransmission is horrible  difficult to launch smoothgas mileage is around  combinedit misses the mark in luxury by neglecting amenities found in competitors such as cooled seats front sensors only has rear rain sensing wipers wood steering wheelon trips longer than  minutes it is not comfortable and the cabin is very crampedno wonder they stopped making this carwe ended up turning the car in early and paying the last  months without having the car  thats how bad it got  in retrospect i would have transferred the lease to another person with  months to go which would have saved quite a bit of money
INFINITI,, infiniti gx
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,g sedan a devil in disguise i bought my g sedan almost a year ago with k within a week had to take it to the dealer for condensation in one of the headlights the dealer replaced it covered under warranty now just within the past month ive had to bring it back to the dealer twice once for the chrome trim peeling on the center console lid and then again for a rattle in the dash rattle in front passenger door and broken cupholder once again the dealer did all work covered under warranty normally i would be just disgusted with a car that gave me these build quality issues but for some reason i seem to fall in love with my g all over again every time i get it back from being in the new q service loaner
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,rattles lack of interior storage  bought september  now has less than  miles on it everything is fine except the rattles from the rear window area i took it to the dealership once but nothing has been solved the rattles are not too bad but still it is definitely something prevents me from enjoying this car dont know whether another people have this problem or i am just unfortunate also the interiorstorage is kinda insufficient overall the rattles really ruins my confidence in buying another infiniti
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,big huge mistakedont you make it too after i went i took the car in for a slipping transmission was told the car needed to be broken in and to come back in a few months i went back in  miles the car will sometimes search for the gear it needs not safe when youre on the highway and attempting to pass another vehicle this car has the potential to leave you hanging for several seconds while it searches and eventually engages the dealer acknowledged that this transmission is suited for a  or  speed not a  but that the car does perform according to how it was built i asked if it would take people getting hurt to get infinity to address the problem and was told yes
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,poor powertrain the vehicle is solid and handles wellgreatly disappointed in the engine and transmissiontransmission seems to take forever to decide what gear to go intogas mileage has averaged  mpg over the  miles i have driven half interstate and half suburbanengine is very weak and combined with the transmission you never know when the acceleration will startlast three cars were  audi a quattro  bmwx and a  bmw ithis infiniti does not compare at all with the driving pleasure of these cars
INFINITI,Price/Value,not worth the money this is not a high end car workmanship is substandard and of cheap quality  its appalling that infinity could turn out such a sloppy product  might look flashy but is rather ordinary and not superior to a honda or nissan  lots of sleek technology but its not useful  car feels too big and gas mileage is terrible  dealership in bayside queens is the worst   too busy with too many people around with no identifiable responsibilities  they will not call back or follow through with any of your problems   car was released not detailed properly with several obvious flaws and not that clean  happy to take your money and then theyre done with you
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,qx test drive it for miles before buying
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,too soon to tell with only  weeks of ownership i cant really tell whats good and whats bad  i do know if your are short in stature hooking the seat belt is almost impossible  i have already used a pull and have an extension ordered  the tailgate is another problem  it is so high i cant reach it  i am waiting for the dealer to install a pull  the qx fulfills my dream of making my last car a luxury one
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,death trap       about  time in  miles this car engine races to  rpm when you start in morning  park place infinity wont help me buyer beware
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,initial disappointment i have had my qx for a little over a week nowi had looked at so many cars that i more than likely rushed to judgement in buying this vehiclemy problem is it was a cold day when i test drove the car and did not notice some things that i have grown to take for granite on a  plus caras an example  touch windows updown ventilated seats no seat lumbar adjustment  touch moonsun roof and i just found out that nissan doesnt even make a cargo net for itnor does this model have blind spot indicators or adaptive cruise control which our k altima had
INFINITI,Price/Value,practical transportation dashboard display is outdated and lacks features that are expected in this price range
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,luxury tank
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,do not buy an infiniti suv  heres why the entire value proposition of this vehicle is way off the costs of ownership are just ridiculous for all infinitis especially the suvs first they are noisy on the inside very much so on the outside second infiniti and nissan have terrible brakes theyre just bad you will end up replacing them faster with the suv in  or less third it guzzles gas maybe it gets  of its low estimate four cost of ownership lose a key fob  one of the door locks broke they want  the front seat motor breaks  this is on a car with  miles on it none of it is covered i wouldnt take another one of these cars if it was free the cost of ownership is ridiculous
INFINITI,Design/Style,yes and no a comfortable car with inexpensive luxury handles well but is a little heavy all the bells and wistles are great and the stereo kicks butt upgraded tired make a world of difference rather bland apperance but hey i could see that before i bought it for the money it was a steal
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,the car you love to hate i love all the technology in this car the interior is roomy and comfortable the back up camera is so helpful and the push button start is very convenient car has a lot of power and gets going really fast i have had many problems with the glove box rattling took it into the dealer and they replaced the glove box but it hangs a little on the left side brakes are horrible on the m sport had to replace all the brakes at  miles if put on any other tires besides the oem ones then the car rides like crap shaking on the freeway and all
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,worst k car on the market the voice navigations system does not work thus you are unable to use the navigation system unless you are parked the voice system can nopt even recognize basis roads such as piedmont road  the dealer says it just works poorly they could not even get the car to recognize the same words  the gas mileage on highway is  miles per gallon which is the worst in class  the sport model rides rough  with so many cars in this class i would not recommend this vehicle and most certainly do not spend the money on the navigation system
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,not a competitive luxury car for a luxury sedan unacceptable windroad noise at highway speed   exceptionally fussyconfusing console stack controls diverting way too much driver attention from the road  unintuitive  clumsy software controlling all the comfort audio  nav features nav system very irritating  cant change destination other than by voice command when car is moving if u dont have an accent or impediment baseline audio system weak compared to lexusbmw console placed for access by a contortionist  bluetooth software couldnt read my cell phone book no routine maintenance service plan included  a cheap touch for a luxury car  seatbelt retractors dont release when leaning forward
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,do not buy infiniti i got my mx only because i am  foot  inch tall and it seemed to be roomy from inside and after driving it for few thousands miles i noted that the engine is very noisy with annoying riddling noise took it to the dealer and they changed the intake did solve the problem changed the exhaust did not solve the problem so finally they called it a character of the cars and i have to accept that i will try to trade it for any other car so my advice is to stay away from any infiniti i dont recommend it at all be smart and pay a little more and get a better car to enjoy not to spend a lot of time in the dealership or over the phone to work on the car it is bad bad bad quality cars
INFINITI,Design/Style,infiniti m is for misery bluetooth failure froze console nissan at first refused warranty repair saying my att was not on their list  but bluetooth is a trademark that requires interoperability  finally they agreed to repair it  this took  tries  then my ac condenser was pierced by a stone  they refused warranty repair because stone chips are excluded this is understandable for paint not for an internal part they should protect with grill work  thats a design defect  their voice recognition for phone numbers is awful  the gas mileage is lower than a good design could have made it
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,its no lexus update back in march of this year i wrote a review of our m awd and complained about among other things the poor gas mileage  in all fairness i need to report that somewhere around k miles the mileage improved  i now get a solid  mpg of mixed driving and  mpg highway  this is with premium fuel and driving driven conservatively  i still blame the awd for a  mpg loss and would encourage new car buyers to press their dealer for rear wheel drive cars  with modern traction control there is very little real world benefit to awd  and given the obvious need to conserve fuel awd just cant be justified in my humble opinion the nature of this car makes it tiring to drive
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,fun car mileage horrible purchased an m with the journey and tech  packages in early september  just hit  miles  this is a fun car to drive  the gas mileage is horrible worse than some suvs  sticker said  mpg in city even with very gentle driving i only get  or  mpg  road noise and engine noise are a little more than i expected but not bad  could use an extra gear  if you step on it to pass at  mpg youre not really going to go anywhere fast
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,waste of money for a luxury vehicle to be a luxury vehicle ride is harsh and rough very noisy  seats are very hard and uncomfortable  poor gas mileage traded in a lexus very poor decision on my part
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,mistake i bought this car for the luxury performance and reliability i love it exceptall the maple moldings on the inside of the doors had to be replaced turned out to be bad glueinfiniti had no problem replacing themat k miles the front left wheel bearing wenthavent ever had that happen on any other carat k miles the transmission went  not in any forward gear but in reverse i generally keep my cars for k miles and ive never had transmission problems or even had to change a clutch needless to say im disappointed
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,excellent electronics poor handling the m awd is an electronics powerhouse with an amazing array of safety and convenient features unfortunately it suffers from a serious steering problem called tramlining which makes the handling not only unsatisfactory but also dangerous i replaced tires twice before i learned from a conscientious mechanic of an infiniti dealership that the problem is with the steering rack which nissan refuses to replace based on this shortcoming i would place a bmw and an audi ahead of an infiniti
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,the ins  outs of qx its a high step to get in in this day  age youd think the interior lights could be leds the front area is poorly designed theres nowhere to put anything down the shift stick is right in middle of everything when you actually use it twice during a long ride  whereas putting things down whether a snack bag or anything else has no room my local service in brooklyn stinks ive heard that complaint from others too
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,the middle seat is trash the middle seat in nd row is absolutely horrible to sit on i cannot stress the pain my buttocks goes through i had to go for surgery due to the hardness of the seat
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,thrid and last infiniti  i have been to the dealership four times and i still have unresolved electrical issues from the bluetooth backup camera truck wont open black screen every other trip turning off clock wont work seatbelts not working  which really pisses me off as i have a child in the car so many issues in a short period of time it has become the worst vehicle i have owned unfortunately and to the point where i will drop the car off back at the dealership and purchase something else i dont have the time to deal with a vehicle of k value as if it were pieced together from spare parts from a junkyard i always read reviews before buying vehicles and i have stuck with nissan  infiniti for the past ten years for their workhorse engines as two of my nissans went to k  k miles but after this suv i am jumping ship as soon as possible
INFINITI,Price/Value,total fail for the price this vehicle has major electrical problems the screen goes completely black and nothing works the safety features fail when driving the only way to fix the electrical failures is to restart the qx  this is not always possible when you are driving  all i have heard from the dealer is corporate is aware of the problems i have video of these problems  it will stall right after starting i have also contacted the ntsb over the headlights in this vehicle they have such a poor range it is dangerous
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,have to say worse purchase ever we have had a large number of cars over the years of varied makes and models and i have to say this has been the worse one ever  the vehicle drives so poorly that none of the  drivers in our home want to get stuck with the infiniti  it has poor acceleration from and stop and worse when entering a highway or passing  to maintain speed the driver must constantly be pressing on the gas pedal as the car gains little to no momentum   it has the same exact instruments as a nissan altima at about x the cost   the brake pedal will travel almost to the floor at times    sport mode makes little to no difference the car drives and acts like the old go karts we all used at amusement parks   we tried to bring this sad vehicle back and were offered almost  less then we paid as we were told they have a poor resale value   i guess we all make mistakes but if you can avoid this one you will be happier
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,worst car ever and worst customer service it is terrible when infiniti customer relations not infiniti service facility just doesnt care  i was told that my car had issues that are not common for most infinitis but as mine was made in tennessee it had some rare issues  these issues started since the first few month on purchase with a moldy smell from ac as stated by service that just wasnt built right and they are looking to correct it had an accident where my auto brake didnt kick in cause of another malfunction when called customer relations they said i would have had to call them before repairs made and i didnt know it was the car until it happened a second time when asked the service how often i should get checked they said never this almost never happens  customer relations still refuses to just get me a repurchase  which is basically giving me the car i paid for without the safety issues and concerns it is sad when even my friends all know that my car is continually in the repair it is also sad when the service department manager gives you the customer relations phone number with what to say because they feel i am there just a little too much i just want what i paid so much for
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,dont be a fool this car has a load of issues  we have put  miles on it and have been to the dealer twice already  the bluetooth cuts in and out  the phone feature fails to place calls for periods of time  the sunroof leaks  the middle row seat vibrates  driving down roads as smooth as silk the middle row seat will vibrate  our boys refuse to sit in the seat  it is unusable  so much for a rd row vehicle the dealer says all the qxs have that feature  when backing up the display has gone completely dark  no camera no audio controls  only way to fix is to restart the car  we purchased this car with the expectation that it would last for many years  i dont see this car making it through spring  we have spent a lot of money for a well below average car and are considering trading it in and cutting our losses  infiniti case   i have videos of all the issues listed above and will post them on youtube  hopefully this will save others from making the same mistake
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,horrible dangerous car and poor infiniti support beware the car has a serious problem where it decides not to accelerate may have to do with the car sensing wheel slippage the transmission issues or well documented but this equally dangerous issue is being ignored  after numerous efforts to get this fixed thru the dealership and infiniti the infiniti consumer affairs team says its a characteristic of the vehicle and not offering a fix dont put your lives in this car   selling mine asap
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,a piece of junk i owned this car for  months too long i wish i had done my research upon purchasing this vehicle the rear differential went out at k miles after replacing the rear differential i noticed stuttering and poor acceleration in the transmission i took it to the dealer and they updated the software but it didnt cure the problem long story short they ended up putting a new transmission in i have had to replace and entire headlamp because the seals went bad and condensation in the lamp was causing a shortage in the bulb after they fixed that headlight the driver headlamp suffered the same issue went back to the dealer for an oil change but noticed my engine light on they discovered that i needed a catalytic converter and a catalytic manifold system this was the worst car i have ever owned do not buy this car that cvt transmission is garbage i can go on and on about repairs and how god awful this car is just leave it at the dealership
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,disgusting car i bought this car with only k miles on it and since that i have driven k miles within these time dealership had to change transmission  times stereo cluster  timea and they still doesnt work do not buy this car  built in usa by usa and it freaking disgusting breaks apart noise bluetooth connectivity forget about i have had infinitis for  years and now i hate it am miserable with this car sometimes ready to smash it to a wall
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,dangerous vehicle purchased my qx  in june  by the end of july with approximately  miles on the car i had major transmission problems the car would jerk and jut accelerating and decelerating very hard and on its own without my foot on the gas from that day on until  weeks ago i had my car in and out of service every couple of months because of transmission problems they could not diagnose it has a horrible shutter that jerks the car around finally they put an update on my car  months after i purchased it and of course it told them to replace the transmission this is a known problem that service writers techs and many customers have experienced i had my new transmission in  weeks and it did the same thing  three weeks after my transmission was replaced they had to put in another in addition to a horribly built transmission the adaptive cruise control which maintains a specific distance from the car in front of it while using cruise control is seriously dangerous and life threatening when a large vehicle like a semitruck passes on the right the vehicle will brake very hard trying to bring it to a stop when you are driving  mph on the interstate you put your life in your hands because any vehicles following behind have no idea you will brake that suddenly for no reason again this is a known issue with service writers and techs it can be terrifying to experience i am in the process of working with the state to have infiniti purchase my car back due to the lemon laws wish me luck
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,worst purchase decision ever very disappointed in this purchase upgraded from a honda oddessey and i regret this decision wholeheartedly it is the roughest ride ever and incredibly uncomfortable i didnt realize how horrific the ride is while test driving because that is usually a quick ride i am constantly yelling at my husband to stop driving like a maniac but am realizing it must be the carmechanics or suspension either way i dislike the feel and comfort of the car more and more everyday i recall it driving slightly smoother the first  months we had it and now  months in were all bouncing out of the seats my kids really dislike riding in the back seats i feel terrible because they werent with us when be test drove it the engine is getting louder by the day i dont care for the way this car shifts gears seems love it revs up very high before finally settling into the right gearthe lift hate is rusted underneath the chrome panels it is currently in the body shop getting replaced let me remind you the car isnt even a year old yetthe temperature is never just right either too hot or too cold the back seat vents are sparse which is likely the reason for the fluctuation in temperature im getting roughly  mpg but do travel frequentlyk mile recommended service is  ray catenas complimentary car wash is a joke very sloppy on the cleaning overall my car still had sticker residue on the outside after a few washed by the dealer i took it to a car wash and paid for the job to be done right it was like night and dayoverall very disappointed should have gone with the mdx you cant see out the back window when the rd row headrests are up and in use
INFINITI,Price/Value,subpar quality as cr recently affirmed qx quality is lacking just about every trim piece whether inside or outside is falling off or has fallen off  even the plastic infiniti label on the back hatch is in the process of falling off  the tires lasted a whopping k miles and at  they are very expensive  the rear brakes and rotors failed at k miles it is underpowered the cvt is annoying it doesnt get particular good mileage and the steering response feels like there is a rubber band between the steering wheel and wheels  the wind noise increases by the day the car is simply falling apart and it is not due to the failing seals because the dealer replaced the seals
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,build quality subpar  fit and finish issues first ive only owned leased it for a few weeks and have only  miles on the carrear passenger door interior panel needed to be replaced  installed poorly and was crackeddash has several rattles and creaksroof rail was improperly installed missing clip and the passenger front door has a paint runalso rear passenger door seal plastic was put on wrong crackedseal was replaced door fixed and the roof rail was reattached but the paint issue and rattles still existcontacted infiniti directly and they did push the dealer to fix the car asap but the build quality is pretty poor compared to other imports or even some us manufacturers
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,qx transmission failure   miles worst experience ever transmission failed after  milesinfiniti refuses to replace the carcar is in the shop longer than was at my housecustomer care does not return calls and this has lasted over a month nowhad very scary experience entering the highway when transmission gave out
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,what a dissapointment i purchased a  qx two months agoin the  weeks that ive owned the car it has been in for service  times due to design manufacturing and workmanship issues from both infiniti and the dealerfirst is a harness issue on the windshieldwas fixed then fell off again after the dealer left fingerprints all over my carthen the driver side heat and heated seat did not workit was supposedly fixed but the day we got it back the heat was still broken the steering wheel was misaligned and have had issues with gears getting stuck when trying to shiftthe topper was today when the dealer picked up the car to fix the heat and the car literally sputtered out of my driveway
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,worst nightmare i owned a jx prior to upgrading to the qx big mistake here is a list of all the issues counting down til  to leave this vehicle at the lot here are the issues i have had with the  qx  and all the times it has been in the service department fuel gauge fluctuations digital reading would jump all over the place did not match the gauge repaired  i had a rattle on the driver side in the window area it was apparent once you reach mph it was taken into infiniti roanoke service department several times	window stripping replaced around windshield did not fix issue	replaced roof rails did not fix issue	car was returned with gash on driver side door sent back for repair	dad discovered front mud flap had a loose screw which was causing issue  i  have a rattle in the steering column it sounds like something is loose inside      issue has never been resolved the driver side sun visor makes a very loud popping noise when you pull it down and push it back up replaced  times  the driver side window making a loud grinding noise issue was fixed the driver window now has a oily residue  after rolling the window down and back upcleaned but shows back up iphone worked intermittently with car ipod controls screen in car would grey out not allowing any functions to be used   passenger seat airbag light stays on with passenger in seat checked but no fix rattle in sunroof area and steering wheel column issue was not fixedstopped taking car to infiniti roanoke and started driving to modern infiniti greensboro sunvisors make a loud popping noise when pulling down and back up replaced passenger seat airbag light recall issue fixed cvt recall serviced weather stripping hanging out from roof rails both rails replaced tv screen stuck and will not release on driver side passenger side tv sticks frequently driver side tv replaced sunroof has ongoing rattle as well as the steering column sunroof repaired after  visits panoramic sunroof stripping out and laying on shade fixed panoramic sunroof stripping out again it also catches and bunches shade up repaired and fixed nd visit driver seat belt will not retract back hangs down calling to schedule service   technician was to come fix seatbelt at home at  tony called at  to tell us that there was an issue to have technician come and repair have to schedule for another date  panoramic sunroof has catch again looks like tape is loose and adhering to shade
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,horrible car experience like in the matrix movie quote when you see an infiniti qx run neo runsince i bought this suv its been at the dealer for repairs almost every  months  headlamp got water inside and had to replace noise on headliner and had to replace entire headliner almost  days without car back again for window motor not closing window back again for transmission issues with k miles only and had to wait one month to be replaced meaning car was a dealer for  days and me without car on top of that back again for other headlamp water replacement again on dealer for rear passenger seat noise and they had to replace it seriously  and all these pain in the neck repairs whats next im sure something else was fixed that i dont recall so i decided to sue nissan yep i want a new car or my money backmy lawyers are asking for that but nissan offered just  compensation are you serious nissan so still in pending responses from nissan before i submit lawsuit im really scare now waiting when this car will brake in pieces on the highway really disappointed with this purchase no recommended to anyone my experience
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,"total sham  mpg what a sham  ive had the car for  months have approximately  miles on it and average about  mpg  the car has been back over  times to the dealer  each time they tell us there is nothing wrong with the vehicle  they even kept the car one day and took it on various trips on the highway off the highway idling in a parking lot etcÂ… and claim that they were able to get the car up to  mpg    since then weve come to find out that the hybrid does not work when the air conditioning is on  really  i live in florida the air conditioning is always on  it would have been nice if this were brought to my attention by the dealer prior to me leasing the car"
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,infiniti offers horrible support bought the  qx hybrid awd  window sticker says mpg combined  im just over  miles the best ive seen is mpg that was fillup in seattle drive i to portland turn around and straight back to seattle cruise control the whole way my regular fill ups are mpg total crap told service manager at dealership i bought it from they drove it for a week and they got mpg so we have a problem right all the service tests they did showed the car operating optimally so they called infiniti and we opened a case infiniti engineer came drove  miles on  gallons which equaled mpg i said how did you do that he couldnt tell me because it was proprietary
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,disappointed i have had one of these as a rental car for over a week and can safely say i dislike it more than the day i got it  as a vehicle it has nice seats and decent room but i expected much more from it the ride for a normal suv is decent but not for this level of suv the trim looks nice but there is cheapness in nasty places for example the plastic on the steering wheel is thin and sticks out almost cutting your hand it has poor acceleration by my standards
INFINITI,Engine/Performance, qx beware of problems everyone knows about the undersized engine etc so im going to share my views on other issues rear seats are not comfortable as the there is no thigh support front seats lumbar does not extend far out enoughcar emits high pitched whistling noise when air is on recirculation take a look at this video on youtubehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrsumvypyitwo car dealers says its normal so if you like your car to whistle then this is the car for youpersonally ive leased  infinitis in the past  years been driving  years and never had this problem in any other car so i dont think its normal i regret my trust in infiniti on this model
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,infiniti qx  the technology behind it miles per gallon features that it offers and perks behindinfiniti connection
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,infiniti three rows with entertainment while infiniti qx was made for hauling seven  the second row seat head rests are in the way when children are sitting in the third row seats making it very difficult to see the entertainment screens that are placed on the back of the front seat headrests  and to put the kids in the second row seats so they can see the screen makes the grandparents in the third row seating very tight especially with foot space  and talking over the entertainment going on in the second row  it just does not work  try again infiniti and actually have real people use
INFINITI,Price/Value,dream cardealership experience not luxurious i wanted this car so bad now i have it and im over it  would turn in now however i know my husband will be irritated with me as ive begged him to get me this car  heres the thing ive driven cadillacs mercedes lincolns this car is very comfortable for our family especially for the price  my issue is with the dealerships  i miss the lincoln dealership experience so much   the other luxury companies offer complimentary maintenance why doesnt infiniti  sorry infiniti but this is why as soon as i can i will be leaving for the new navigator or escalade  theres no way om earth that i would upgrade to the qx and not have the same luxury dealer experience that the other companies offer  i literally felt like i was back at the pontiac dealership from my college days not a good thing for a luxury company  this may be the reason you had to offer huge discounts on your vehicles as there arent many of them on the road  im over infiniti experience such a rip off plus the technology infiniti vehicles are several years behind the times
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,long time running  miles with only oil changes
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,highway cruise a consistant  mpg with  percent
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,hold on to your hat with a  hp engine that it shares
INFINITI,Price/Value,infiniti m purchased one year ago have identical
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,m more like a  been in the shop at least  times for repairs  for the same thing  hesitates when accelerating at low to medium speeds  great at highway speeds now gas gauge doesnt work uses  qt of oil every  miles and pings like crazy when first started  worst car i have ever owned
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,"longevity i wonder i have k miles and see puff of blue smoke on cold start up along with a broken driver seat cooling switch dealer had car for two wks told me it needed engine decarbonization and a broken wiring harness in the seat to no satisfaction the blue smoke still appears on every cold start they tell me its the advanced oiling system providing more oil in the valvetrain area and just burnoff i say bullshit called infiniti direct they said whatever the dealer says is what they go by i cant speak to a regional rep nothing my only course of action see another dealer and get a second opinion gee thanks for the help mr manufacturer"
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,infinity m  the turning radius on this supposed
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,"unsafe to drive at certain speeds unsafe factors are that the vehicle hesitates two to three seconds when sudden acceleration is required such as for merging lanes in freeway trafficthe cruisecontrol collision avoidance feature tends to cause rearend collisions because it causes the vehicle to suddenly decellerate when it tries to pass a trucktrailer rig on anadjacent freeway lane especially on an inside curvethere is a severe blind spot at the left and right windshield post and adjacent car door where the rearview mirrors are mounted for people of short stature like myself a problem for close manuvering"
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,mgreat car this is a terrific vehiclepowerful and
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,"fun ride this car is truly a wolf dressed insheeps clothing its benign exteriorlooks give no indication of the monsterunder the hood acceleration is pushyou back in your seat quick andhandling is precise anyone who picks afight with this car will lose itsinsulting to this car to obey speedlimits yes trunk space is poor theyhave wedged the fuel tank in between therear seat and trunk alledgedly this isa safety issue"
INFINITI,Design/Style,poor paint ive owned for  years i have  miles on the car the paint on the grill is bubbling and the artificial chrome is wrinkling ive sold automotive paint all my life this only occurs if the product painted does not have a clean surface infiniti will not do anything about the problem
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,k miles later i wrote a review  years ago when i leased the car but now after  years k miles later ive changed my tune  the fx is purely eye candy and has no uses as an suv it lacks in space trunk area is half of any other suv  passenger leg room is minimal and my family of  barely fits in the car cant even take road trips because its so small the snow feature sounds like a tonka truck falling down stairs when it activates services cost more than my bmw m and parts are very expensive  if the weather gets below  degrees the cars performance and driverfeel becomes subpar  after i hit k miles the car started to feel like it had k miles i would not purchase this car again
INFINITI,Design/Style,second look i just got mine and although it is fun to drive the blue tooth is lousy does not have self locking doors and find the seats uncomfortable but other than that it is a blast to drive and when you step on the gas it is there for you
INFINITI,Design/Style,disappointed ive owned my fx for two months now and im still having a difficult time getting used to the ride the ride is very rigid and the steering wheel vibrates when hitting a bump maybe this car should be labeled as a sports car instead of crossover suv  if youre looking for a  car ride you might want to consider another vehicle
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,unhappy owner we have the rear wheel drive sports pkg and cannot wait to get rid of it it jerks all over the place knobsswitches not in good locations stiff suspension tight steering poor traction in snow etc etc etc  we will never own another infinitinissan again  we will stick with lexustoyota in the future
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,too much noise the fx is a fun car to drive because it handles beautifully  however i quickly grew disappointed with the vehicle because the leather squeaks and the vehicle is not very tight  i found little rattles here and there which grew very annoying over time  unless this doesnt bother you stay away from an fx
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,worst car i ever owned  hate this car buyer bewaretransmission problem with the infinity fxi do not feel safe driving this cartransmission gets stuck between rd and th gear causing lag in speedcant pass or merge into traffic without worrying that i will not be able to pick up speeddoes not happen every time so cant preparethen when stoping car lurches forward dealer claims that it is due to the change they made from a  speed to a  speed and that is just the way the car drivesare you kidding melook up transmission problems on edmonds for this carmany complaintsthey want to charge me over  to return the car and they consider this a favorthere is no fix nor change to newer model
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,seats in  i purchased a  infiniti fx with the understanding that i was getting leather seats the sells paper says leather when i google the vehicle it says leather in  the seats had to be repaired now in  the seats have to be repaired again i have contacted an attorney and consumer affairs about this false advertisement the cars with no leather sell for  i paid over  for my car with the understanding that i was getting leather seats i contacted infiniti and they forwarded my email to consumer affairs if you purchased the vehicle and the sells paper said leather seats you should join me in this lawsuit i am waiting for an attorney to contact me
INFINITI,Price/Value,overall this crossover stinks gas mileage is horrible shimmy at   on balanced aligned tires horrible gas mileage brakes wear relatively fast and rotors warp as fast poor gas mileage doors do not lock when vehicle starts moving for safety not a very quiet ride navigation stinks very expensive to maintain very could ride smoother did i mention horrible gas mileage
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,had to do it again the lease on my  fx was up i loved it but just wanted a change i drove a lot of cars had experience in bmw xi x porsche cayenne s range rover touareg mdx rdx previously owned  lexus rxs and a couple explorers when it came down to it there wasnt anything else out there that imo topped the fx  the fx just sticks to the ground you dont turn a corner you think the car around the corner steering is tight and cyl engine is powerful  cant imagine why anyone would want a fx  a little heavy on gas though premium is recommended no problem on regular the fx does have a huge blind spot my  was tough learning to back up but the rear camera is a dream
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,not happy just leased an  fx very disappointed has been in for service twice for the gps works now but not very well i am still using my old portable because it works sooo much better the bluetooth will not sync with my blackberry check engine light come on every once in a while cruise control only works about  of the time all of this with less that  miles
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,not worth even considering why buy this crossover i bought it and i hate it and for solely one particular reason the transmission dear infiniti you tried and failed miserable on manufacturing a  speed transmission mercedes can make  speeds lexus can make a seamless  speed but you infiniti are poor at making a  speed why does this car shift into th gear at  mph whoever is reading this this car looks nice it looks sexy the interior is gorgeous but only because of the transmission do not buy it consider the bmw x or x or perhaps the mercedes ml  but please do not buy this deceiving suv i miss my m
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,review after  months of driving it i have driven the car for  months and  miles i agree with rick   speed tranny ruins the overall experience of owning this car  shifts all over the place i have the latest transmission flash and still show very harsh downshifting after releasing the gas pedal this initially scared the daylights out of me when it first happened now i just come to expect it  only ds drive sport mode returns control to the driver and allows you to get around horrible gear ratios and indecisiveness of the computer as to what gear the car needs  also brakes are very soft  takes longer to stop and gas mileage is mediocre  no tranny change  so if you consider buying youre warned
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,shame to infiniti  this is my second inf after  fx which i really enjoyed i got the new  fx i have never been so unhappy with a vehicles performance and fuel economy my old one was showing about  mpg mostly city drive and new improved shows the same driving experience horrible unless i drive about mph in slow traffic the shifting is all over the place sometimes it feels like someone bumps you behind also maybe because car is to heavy or because of transm issues when my car starts driving it feels like its choking on fuel i took car already a few times to dealer who claims that he did some reprogramming but so far i do not see any changes and think it will be my last infiniti
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel, fx a setback from my  bought a  fx  weeks ago trading in a   upgraded to nav with touchscreen  so far a lot of disappointments   its slower i punch it getting on the freeway it hiccups  the  took off   adding nav adds other functions like touchscreen traffic but diminishes other features a reduces bluetooth phonebook capacity by  b eliminates ability to program pause worked on  c added cumbersome steps to dial phone dsound system audio quality diminished e ipod interface nice but ipod battery runs down after car shutoff  autoturnon not turnoff  much less room in backseatmy riders complain  promised improved mileage is really worse just a bigger gas tank
INFINITI,Price/Value,just a poor designed car i bought a fully loaded fx but i am disappointed about the car when driving in highway the car sometimes hesitates to shift to a lower gear during acceleration and it chokes up first time i reported this problem to the dealer they told me infiniti is aware of the problem but doesnt have a fix for it yet but later on they took it back and said this is a normal behavior they just had a recall on the replacement of steering column electrical tilt motor also only after  miles the dealer had to keep my car for  week to fix rear window after one week they gave the car back to me unfixed and told me that infiniti doesnt have the spare part in inventory
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,what were they thinking this is our rd fx since  our th infiniti overall since then this blows away my  and  fx  however two issues that they fell asleep on they took away the compass on the mirror and the compact flash reads some things and misses others no current support on that issue  the compass was useful when navigation did not have an address in its database now forced to look at the little compass on the nav screen and figure out which way you headed  it takes a few seconds to figure it out when you could just look at your mirror and see the direction by letters the cd harddrive takes forever to copy songs into memory basically useless  compact flash very picky and fussy
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,awful trans  i had the  fx and i loved it so i just had to have  i like the improved interior and the new look but the ride is still hard my main problem is the speed transmission the car only accelerates smoothly when rapidly accelerating accelerating from about  mph or  mph is awful it never seems to know what to shift in too its a nightmare when driving in traffic because it keeps downshifting and then it lags when it should up shift i end up using the paddle shifters to make the trans do what it should be doing on its own i was thinking it was only my car and maybe something is wrong with my trans but i see that someone else had the same issue
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,almost this is a replacement of my  fx which i liked this has improved comfort seats and ride  my main problem is the awful speed transmission badly programmed  this is supposed to be a sporty car  the car only accelerates smoothly when rapidly accelerating accelerating from about  mph or  mph requires full accelerator to get a downshift or nothing happens quickly around those speeds the transmission cant seem to make up its mind and makes it hard to maintain a constant speed with frequent downshifting i have never owned a car with such inconsistent throttle response
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,not happy paint is pealing dashboard melted and requires a lot of maintenance
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance, fk i just sold my  fx fully loaded w  miles to a dealer i only got  for the fx i did not want to sell the fx to a private party because the fx started using a quart of oil every  miles
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,transmission failure at k i bought my fx from an infiniti dealership with k almost five years ago i now have kin this time i have gone through two dash boards due to deffects in the material which was fixed by the dealerships two tears in the side of the uphostery a small plastic gear in the front seat controls has broken which is a  bill and now the transmission has failedi took the car into the dealership for an unusual noise in the drive train and routine maintenacei picked it up and it wouldnt shift into reverse without pressing down on the gas pedaland then there are those horrible horrible bridgestone potenza tires
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,not too happy with the car nothing special get sick driving after a while the car is too bumpy small on cargo space trunk is too small
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,surprisingly disappointed   love the look  and you wont see many of these on the road however dont buy on this alone like i did  caution if you get motion sickness easily  ive owned mine a week now and unfortunately i was ready to take it back after  day  for those who dont know what a stiff ridetight suspension means pay attention to the way this vehicle rides  even the tar lines on roads feel like big bumps  on some roads with multiple repairs i actually feel like my eyes are bouncing  making it not only uncomfortable but annoying  also make sure you consider the seating  i ache when i get out  both my back and seat and im a healthy woman with no achespains  until i drive in this seat
INFINITI,Design/Style,just my view overall i like this car  however at times when making turns the wheels feel like they are a little loose also the car make a little startup noise after sitting in cooler weather ie  degreesi live in south florida
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,disappointed bought the car new in southern california after five years of the door lock fails intermittently depending on ambient temperature leather seat splits at the most unusual area fuel gauge does not function properly and the dash board starts to blister and bubble not to mention the power rear view mirror does not readjust properly at times my honda accord of  years never had these problems i applaud infiniti for fixing some of the problem at no cost but still it is a nuisance the infiniti experience is a bit tainted based on these events
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,sports car with a big trunk the fx  gives you the thrill of a sports car with the carrying capacity of a small suv the fx is very reliable it hasnt been in the shop except for scheduled maintance the sports suspension is very tight with no roll common to most suvs
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,think before you buy my fx has more rattles than any vehicle i have owned which include acura audi volvo honda etc every week there is something annoying  rattle of the week problems with driver seat which the dealer cant fix problem with alignment of the headlight which dealer cant fix busted stereo and cd player problem with rearseat belt when i take the car through a carwash water leaks in  the paint on this vehicle is paper thin  slightest nick and it chips off and rusts in less than few weeks the vehicle is a pain to maintain repeated brake problems very stiff ride the build and mechanical quality is bad enough that this will be my last infinity and city fuel economy of mp
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,"bad brakes this is a great car with bad brakes  i had to have a brake job at k    ive talked with  other owners that have had similar problems  the dealer had the nerve to say i was riding the brakes  inifiti customer service says its normal wear and tear and thety wont do anything  infiniti if youre listening i want my brake job paid for"
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,bionic cheetah been a sports car person all my life
INFINITI,Design/Style,black infiniti i like everything about the car except
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,"please read this true facts by an owner just bought this car  months ago and it is very fun to drive  very uncomfortable in the back when you have  adults  getting out of the back seat is a challange  the space between the door frame and the seat is too narrow  could be better  you can feel almost every bump on the road  the navigation stops working if there is a ez pass decale on the dash  the wheels are too big for the model to handle so the car pulls to one side or the other even if there is a wheel alignment done  the gas mileages got worse even though the same grade of gas is added every time gas was needed and the car has not been serviced by anyone other than the dealership"
INFINITI,Price/Value,family vette we have logged nearly k miles in our fx sporttouring awd it handles like a big corvette very tight  sporty feel we use this vehicle as a daily driver as well as for vacations out of state as it gets mpg hwy vs mpg in our land rover it has some of the quality that nissan is known for however it is pricier to maintaine surprisingly i have had a wheel bearing fail multiple recallswarranty repairs  two break jobs all within  thousand miles my wife enjoys driving this vehicle but i am not sure if i will keep it once the warranty expires
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,dizzy in this car you can feel every single bump in the road that was something to get used too
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,bad cam after  months of purchase i purchase on  a fx  with  miles three months later the check engine light turns on and has problems starting the mileage at this time was  miles after  weeks at the dealer they told that the camshaft went out  very dissatisfied with this infiniti
INFINITI,Price/Value,all u need its has all the horns and bells u need
INFINITI,Price/Value,the second owner bought this qx used with k miles on ityes you may think im crazy but this car had all that i was looking for and the price was workable one owner all maintenance records just need new tires and wiper bladeso i thought needed oil rings replaced  running like brand new now at k on it will drive to miami in a new york minute i want to hit k then maybe i will trade it for a pathfinder le since they stopped making these in infiniti
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,too many expensive repair problems i liked the look and ride but the repair bills killed me shocks catalytic converters fan motorexhaust system fuel injecters leaked resale value  trade in not good bad fuel mileage
INFINITI,Design/Style,wife wont trade it my wife drives this qx  and
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,luv to drive always had sport cars or muscle cars
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,"qx not perfect either with jeep notes also looked at jeep yukon envoy  all were nice  picked the qx over new jeepothers due to expected durability  qx had problems i didnt expect  the day of delivery i noticed all mode x got a faint vibration and hum above mph noticable only on smooth asphalt highways  front drive shaft ujoint was bad the roof rack makes a loud whistle  feels more cramped than jeep i would not pay retail for a qx  i got  off sticker and yr  financing take a long drive before signing on the dotted line  try everything  there should be no change in ride when switching to all mode from wd mode gas consumption worse than jeeps lv"
INFINITI,Price/Value,"what a deal for the  not sure about everyone else but i got my wd with a sticker of  for   it was a demo with about k miles on it  i did all of my homework weighed the pros and cons of each  vehicle and decided for the money i could not go wrong  the only other serious contender i had was an ml  but you know how hard it is to get a discount on a mercedes so for k less it was a no brainer  besides the deal though  i love the car"
INFINITI,Price/Value,"understated luxury if you dont need the ego enforcing mb or lexus emblem but want a luxury suv thatll last this is it  lexus camry platform minivan acura minivan nice if you like the looks mercedes check consumer reports or newsgroups piece of crap bmw cough pricey jeep etc garbage see consumer reports newsgroups"
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,i love this suv hate to give it up  this suv is amazing it i purchased this suv in  at the time it had k miles on it im still driving this suv with k miles on it and counting it has survived hurricane katrina in  a wreck in  and ive never replaced the timing belt as of yet i regular have my oil change yearly maintenance and i replace one oxygen sensor its leaking oil at this point but ive traveled back and forth in this suv from new orleansla to dallas tx for over  years now i hate to give it up but i will eventually its not idling correctly anymore im impressed you were able to sell it with those miles on it i am skeptical anyone would want to purchase it with the miles and minor issues it has but kudos to you im looking into purchasing a bmw x  or benz ml which seems to have bad reviews but i want to buy the vehicle i desire opposed to one thats economical i know it sounds crazy but i want to live it up and not settle the suv that can not be killed
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,the truck that cant be killed i got a qx when i started school it had  km on at at that time well i drove it for three years without doing any maintenance at all except wiper bladesit was at  then and i had to get the front brakes done while i was there the mechanic said i should get the timing belt done too he said they are supposed to be done every k and this one had never been replaced i finished school and told myself i would drive it until it died and then buy a new carthree years went by and it never died i had to replace one oxygen sensor and they fiddled with a wire once because of a nock sensor i sold it  weeks ago at k kilometers and i cant believe how it held its value
INFINITI,Design/Style,tough buildsoft drive qx is a greate suv  it is tough but
INFINITI,Price/Value,"hmmm i bought this car with only k last year its been very reliable but does lack power the worst part of this car is the suspension my little frontier rides like a cadillac compared to the qx any slight bump in the road and the suspension bottoms out like you just dropped off a ft cliff this is embarrassing when you are taking friends around and its supposed to be a luxury suv the shocks were replaced and it made no difference also no one makes anything other than oem shocks so you cant even put stiffer shocks if you wanted to needless to say this will be my last qx"
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,"qx better than pathfinder i would say that the qx is a leap ahead of the n pathfinder  its interior and body molding were superb  i do have a problem with the horrible gas mileage and stiff steering  while i owned this vehicle i had to get the emmissions corrected twice and both front struts had to be replaced  maintenance on this vehicle is expensive  if i had to do it over again i wouldve bought a denali instead or maybe a used jag xj  one last thing if you like putting up hills at five mh then this is the car for you"
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,dependable purchased the car in  and still going strong it the end of  with miles  had one repair in  years for approx and a tow  paint started to go bad in door in
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,rust machine the qx has been very reliable for me but its not my everyday drive vehicle ride is real rough in the back and the cabin is a bit small but at the time that i purchased it there were not a lot of options in midsized suvs for a vehicle that mostly sits in a garage around  yrs old it has had a lot of rust issues mainly behind the fender flares and the running board infiniti would not do anything for me and wanted  for new running boards so i had a body shop redo the metal for the running boards for around  each i do think i will by infiniti again because they did not stand behind the rust guarantee a  vehicle should not have rust that much so soon
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,lots of issues i had so many problems with this cars i even had  of these got rid of one and got another same bunch of issues  tranny has issues only k on it  new trans new alternator new pullys new rotors strut replaced turn signal stick muffler pipes broke brakes awful radio replaced windows are slow if youre gonna buy this only get the  maybe they worked out some of the issues had to do a lemon law case on it beware
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,beauty without brains although this suv appeals to my senses it has become a disappointment from an owners view  i am a small  female but find this suv cramped both front and back drivers seat is small and uncomfortable on long drives  back seat has no head room for taller people  gas mileage is poor wish they had not made it a wd i have yet to use it having mechanical problems  miles check engine soon light comes on and auto will run like choke is stuck  later it will correct itself until another time i expected to get  from an infiniti with routine maintenance without any problems needs true engine reliability   expected more from an infiniti
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,"i wont buy another infiniti it is very hard for a short person to get in and out of this vehicle the running boards are useless they are too high the radio display is extremely hard to see and impossible to read when driving the rear wheel wells are in the way of the door opening the gas mileage needs much improvement the tilting steering wheel hardly tilts the headlights have very little difference between high beams and low beams"
INFINITI,Design/Style,still buying em ive owned the   and now the   there is no better value out there the proof is in the fact that it is difficult to even find a low mileage one preowned there is a rumor that infiniti is in the design stages to bring it back due to customer demand i will be the first person sleeping on line outside the dealers door to buy it
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,after  years we use it for highway driving and it
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,"drives like a sedan if you are in the market for a rugged suv that has all the comforts of a luxury sedan the qx is it  test drove the mercedes suv acura and lexis and none compared to both the rugged capabilities in conjunction with luxury of the infiniti"
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,qx the suv that shines i bought my qx and it performance is
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,well designed sports sedan i bought my g used with only k miles and now it has k  i love the design of the g both inside and out   the interior is very classy and sleek  i think the later updates like the g lost some of the good looks  the performance is fun and though the car feels heavy on the road its fun to drive and the engine sound is great   it jumps off the line but the at shifting isnt the smoothest  ive been disappointed by the gas mileage often around mpg in the city and  on the highway  with climate change out of control and oil companies controlling our government i hate giving money to those sociopaths  my next car will be electric  you cant rotate the tires so they dont last super long  it has some serious blind spots you need to be aware of   and there are a few problem areas that pop up  control arm bushings go bad brakes dont last too long and tend to squeal a bad cam shaft sensor recently made my car die on the freeway truck release wire snapped miscellaneous electrical issues and a lot of random rattles and ticks in the dashboard that cant be located or silenced  i wouldnt say its unreliable but its not the most reliable car ive owned  my wife has a bad back and the passenger seat isnt comfortable for her  all these issues aside ive really enjoyed the car and dont regret buying it
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,never again bought my  laser red coupe used in summer of   was my dream car key word  was  until after a few months in  it was a one owner with a clean carfax  had k on it when i bought it   i now have k on it and have already had major issues with the car  tire pressure light keeps tripping and flashing leather is tearing and showing wear bose system went out a  repair and dont even get me started on the paint finish  the car only has k miles and it looks as if its been sand blasted or towed behind a gravel truck  dealership is extremely arrogant lazy and it takes almost up to two weeks just to get in for a simple oil change  never again  mercedes here i come
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,good car but has its faults  i have owned my infiniti g mt coupe for almost  years now  i have app  miles on it and i can say i am ready to get rid of the car the issues i have are the expensive oil changes and maintenance costs for example the tires  the ride quality is rough and after k the rattles start to be heard due to the poor construction of the cabin  the drivers seat position is very tight leather wears quickly  the non bose audio system i have is absolutely horrible the speakers and dash appointment look like they are straight out of an altima for years ago  the car is also the worst car i have ever owned in the snow despite  snow tires  the shifting linkage is not crisp
INFINITI,Price/Value,infinitihard to deal with things keep breaking on this car and infiniti does nothing to help  i have had to buy brakes and rotors every  milesfirst there was a recall and they paid for it nd time there was no recall anymore and somehow there never was one and i had to pay  actually they told me i was lucky that i was going  miles cause most people only go  infiniti is terrible to deal with when a there is a problem
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,julies g this car is fun to drive and i love it although without any doubt vision while in reverse is severely impacted i  also feel that the transmission shifts a bit roughly given the category and have been told by three passengers that the front seats were narrow and uncomfortable especially on travels lasting over  minutes
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,g spot in a flash grew up in a dealership and i cant remember all the cars i have had in my life including a vette the g outshines them all
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,be very very careful had the car two weeks and the transmission had to be replaced  dealer gm treated me as if i was an idiot  no feedback from infiniti after complaint  now has developed rattles and tranny is still noisy and whines on decel  stay away from this car  infinitinissan obviously does not care at all about customer satisfaction
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,this or mustang draws looks and positive comments k  no seat memory visibility soso quickness average seat belt awkward rides better with the winter tires  than the  wheels have not figured out the navigation system yet wife loves the color slate
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,not a comfortable ride awful mpg if you want a comfortable ride look elsewhere this car has a horrible ride which two weeks after i bought i regret it so much gas mileage is ridiculous down to mpg on highway ready other reviews i lost some money but i trade it in for a bmw  after  weeks and i am much more happier now
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,unimpressed my g rwd has auto tranny premium pkg but not the sport pkg the car has been quite reliable i like the supple ride bose stereo and bluetooth feature the keyless feature is a gimmick if you drive it like a luxury car it performs pretty well  however if you want to drive it like the sports sedan as it claims to be you may be disappointed like i am the engine is loud and severely lacks low end torque and the auto tranny is slow and jerky among the worst ive experienced combined with slow yet heavy steering soft suspension and crappy tires the car is very unsatisfying to drive on top of that the gas mileage has been consistently worse than that of our midsize suv
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,poor build quality fun to drive if you can stand the rattles from the windows fsbs on the s but not yet on the s infiniti denies there is any issues on the s and will not repair infiniti knew there were problems for  years and contiuned to sell these cars and did nothing to fix the rattles
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,too stiff to ride have owned this car for almost  years now cant wait to get rid of it ride is too stiff to get comfortable driving on a bad road is a nightmare the interior seems to fall apart every time car goes over a bump not to mention rattle sound made by interior plastic performance is ok other than that this car stinks wouldnt buy this car ever again
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,not a comfortable ride everything is good about the car except for the plastic interior hard suspension and uncomfortable seats
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,unbeatable about  months in to my g coupe and i
INFINITI,Price/Value,"short and to the point just traded in a  m and i have no regards at all"
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,poor gas milage car is great in every way just really really bad on gas
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,keep away  bad brakes trust me  this car is a nightmare with the brakes  if you dont believe me research all of the comments online  we have had the car for  years and have replaced the brakes  times  every year  the car only has  miles on it  every time you have to replace the brakesrotors it is   i want to get rid of this lemon
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,i like the basics but comfort is wanton bought the  speed sports sedan for my wife and is a powerful and fun car to drive but creature comforts are lacking   way drivers seat is mediocre passenger seat is downright bad  leg comfort and back support is horrible i do not understand how this car could be considered for car of the year so many times
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,high miles  disappointing i bought my car with  from a dealer and immediately had trouble with the following things  power steering   gas door actuator  internal fuel system  air bags  cd player  blue smoke when i start the car  i have had it in the shop almost once a month maybe it is just a lemon the car just rolled over  miles and i am trading it in tomorrow yay i owned a  lexus gs before this car and the lexus blew this out of the water
INFINITI,Price/Value,very disappointed horrified by the poor tire wear at  miles my tires were completely bald  infiniti says they normally replace them around k now i am at k and the front insides are torn up and need to be replaced thats right only  miles on the tires said it was the alignment i will be looking to trade this car in within the year i cant afford to replaces tires twice a year especially at the price our tires are
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,great purchase i bought a used  gx w k on the odometer  i was looking for a used altima or maxima but came across the infiniti and was sold the moment i stepped on the gas  reading the reviews put me over the edge  ive now had it a year and a half and have k on the odo  no maintenance issues but gas is a bit of an expense  i average mpgs combined and pumping premium fuel sucks  comfortable on long rides and im tall and have back issues  getting out is a little awkward bc it sits so low
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,poor interior quality this cars dashboard is cracking and the edges are warping which i can only imagine is because of the poor quality materials used to put it together the handles and steering wheel buttons are all peeling this is very disappointing i would have imagined a wellmaintained luxury vehicle would have lasted would have spend my money elsewhere infiniti consumer affairs is a joke and offer no resolution
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,whats with the nay sayers i really dont understand some of you peoples gripes about this car tires and brakes worn out in less than a yr averaging mpg well how about you slow it down thats whats you can expect when your flooring it every time your behind the wheel even one person that complained about everything in regards to how the car looked inside well then why did you buy it the appearance didnt change after you made your purchase did it quality on this car is top notch its a nissan made vehicle of course the ride feels extremely stable in all maneuvers yeah the average of about  to  mpg is a bit on the low side but when your pushing out hp what do you expect
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,beautiful car but expensive to maintain this is a beautiful and powerful  horsepower car  however it is a sport edition which means different sized tires  this is a nightmare  not only are the tires expensive but i am on my third yes i said third set and i only have k on the car  also the gas mileage is horrible  it averages about mpg  terrible
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,bluetooth is poor be informed infiniti provides a list of compatible phones that will work with the g on their website  the selection of cellphones is poor and when infiniti was contacted they could not explain how they would keep in pace with new cell phone offerings amongst the various carriers i was not informed of this prior to purchase and have found it to be a disappointment due to the fact my freedom of choice in selecting a cellphone has been eliminated
INFINITI,Price/Value,g coupe fun to drive  i have the sport tuned suspension and it rides rough so it tends to rattle inside  it sticks to the road although i understand the tires dont last long and they are expensive
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,too many problems im not happy with the car after almost two years the mileage is horrible  mpg and the brakes have been replaced twice already at  miles the cd changer has gone out twice and the tires are cupping and making lots of noise since the backs are a different size and they are unidirectional they cant be rotated  road noise is very loud from the tires im ready to sell it
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,g for greatness
INFINITI,Price/Value,repairs very expensive i purchased the car new  years ago with the optional  year warrantyive had all service done at my infinity dealership and total repairs not covered under warranty to date are my wife purchased the acura tl the same day  years ago with the  year warrantyall her service was done at the acura dealership and total repairs to date are i love driving the infinityi dont care for the acura but the repairs are just expensive to her carthats really my only complaint about the carboth extended warranties just expired last week and both cars have around  milesi probably will purchase another infinity when this car dies
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,love the car but overall this has been a great carhowever we are experiencing a big problem with the front side airbagsjust replaced the drivers side a few months ago to the tune of  now the drivers side bag has failed and infiniti wants even morei believe this is a serious safety problem and extremely priceyfurther inifiniti will not give any leeway to me even though this is a problem that should not be occurring in any carthey appear to not want to stand behind safety issuesbtw whats worse they turned this over to nissan so even though you may think youre buying a premium car they treat this as a nissan problemacura completey stood behind a seatbelt issue
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,fast and fun  bought my base  g sedan in march  with k miles on it  unreal power good brakes stiff chassis for instant steering response and decent cornering  the price for this is a stiff but wellcontrolled ride fuel mileage is  around town  highway i actually like the  interior instruments  controls better than the up g  a minor annoyance is a very creaky center console which is worse on cold days  had the engine die on me  times with an error code displayed although it would restart in a minute or less the dealer ended up replacing a cam position sensor for free even though the yr warranty had expired
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel, infiniti gx owner report overall the gx is fun to drive and has lots of power  the awd really grabs the road and makes cornering a breeze  gas mileage is poor for a six cyl i get about  on the road and  around town  my previous vehicle a  cyl bonneville with efi got  around town and  on the road with only slightly less pep
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,sweet v this is a very well built piece of machinery  the tires that came with the vehicle were terrible but other than that i give it an a
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,eh  not so much this car should not be compared in the same class as a bmw series acura tl audi a as it is often grouped with  to me  the car sits a lot higher and does not turn or corner as well as these vehicles  city driving is brutal on mpgim afraid to even measure  i own a mt sedan you have to really put the pedal down if you want to see any performance otherwise it drives like any regular sedan
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,my g check for oil consumption
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,i would not buy a g  hard to turn uncomfortable ride high noise level  to  gass milage in town  open road electric window and wiper motors have gone out read center brake light outoil dip stick design and locationviolative content deletedpananger seat is a pain in the ass and back hard to get out of i am an ergonomic engineer mit and mechanical engineer inia i can speek with some athority the car was given to me thank god i did not pay for itergonomic design for interior does not match my honda   dr the honda is a better car
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,infiniti blows smoke this was supposed to be my wifes dream car but has turned into a nightmare  infiniti does not stand behind its cars  after several attempts at fixing a knocking noise at startup and excessive white smoke from the exhaust a service manager told us that our car was not qualified for warranty work  this car continues to consume a quart of oil every month  think twice about infiniti
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,"disappointed while the car is eye catching changing brakes every  miles means to me that infiniti made a big material mistake  when it snows and you open the door snow falls from the window onto the seatnot very comfortabletires wear out prematurely dust from the brake rotors fill the rims immediately after the car is washed  infiniti should continue to replace the brakes for freethe owner should not be penalized for the material problem  rattles are significantly annoying dealership was not particularly accomodating"
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,dont buy after owning this vehicle nd owner for  years i have replaced the whole braking system  times the stereo console quit which had to be replaced at  and then i now have to replace the whole engine at  km  for a luxury car this is the absolute crap  i will never buy nissaninfinity again  inifinti customer service is a waste of time  dont buy
INFINITI,Price/Value,circuite board we have had  infinitis and have been very happy until this g the circuit board controlling the ac heater stereo cd etcwill not work it has been stuck with no stereo cd and ac has been at  degrees for the last  months we have been told it will cost  to fix it if we are lucky this seems so outrageous to us we feel infinite has let us down totally this should be a recall as the mechanic said many cars of this model have come in for the same problem we are very disappointed in infiniti and would never buy another if this is the way they stand behind their clients so sorry
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,reliable performance car i have to say overall this has been a very reliable car after  miles it still runs strong and has very little problems however over the life of my ownership i have had to replace the wiper motor rear axle bearings radioclimate control electronics and driver seat slide mechanism it also as others have noted has a weak design of the front wheel struts which continually creak when making hard turns this is especially noticeable during cold winters i have averaged  miles on the highway which is  of my yearly miles so it is respectable all in all im sold on infiniti and have just purchased an  m as a replacement
INFINITI,Price/Value,wow i brought this car for my daughter i wanted something to last her through college last sunday my husband and i was on our way to the store and got hit by a  g that was tboned by a drunk driver going a  miles a hour there was  yards of debris and both g  was totaled but the safety features saved our life if we were in any other car my husband would probably be dead i will be replacing the car with the same model
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,problem w center console i am stuck with luxury car that i cant operate the temperature or have any music because the whole center console is out  no button works  didnt know there was a recall but as with mike a even though  model for some horrible reason my vin number doesnt qualify which beats me
INFINITI,Design/Style,dont buy a used g i like the g overall but this car is not your usual reliable japanese sedan it has weird reliability issues eg the suspension lower arm link broken  miles the brake squeak  miles the dashboard light went out  milesall those little things that drive you nuts because you would expect better from infiniti i wish i wouldve gotten an acura instead owned  of them in the past and had no problem whatsoever at least till  miles
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,dollars vs reliabilty purchased the car from my brother k who owned it since new  replaced my  bmw i with k  the mileage is awful the maintenance costs are outrageous the radiocd changer cost me  to fix  month ago the tires are super expensive the trunk has no handle to open it the driver seat controls are placed in the worse place in the galaxy there is little storage space in the cabin the back seats should fold down but  the engine performance and handling is magnificent my electric red bmw used to stop folks in their tracksthe g is stately is it worth the  to run
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,love the car me and my girlfriend had a few doubts about the car but all have been proven wrong gas mileage is poor if u drive it hard and yes brakes go quickly but its crash impact ratings sold us and the bargain price our previous car was a toyota solara which cost more but wasnt half as fun to drive only beefs are the emergency brake interfering with left shin and window controllers are a lil low transmission can be slow at times but engine is definitely not fun to drive with vdc turned off
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,i love my g i bought my car back in june  used with k on it and now it has k on it i havent had any trouble mechanically on it except for as soon as my warranty expired my cd changer broke but i hear thats common with all indash cd changers i had to replace every door panel bc the leather was coming loose but that was all warranty and the infiniti dealership had not seen that before
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,fun to drive  expensive to own this car is a lot of fun to drive  it begs to be turned loose on winding roads unfortunately the reliability is horrible since i purchased it i have had the drivers seat mount break it would move all over the place while driving  a little too exciting brakes replaced at  miles and a complete clutch  flywheel replacement at  the first two were covered by the warranty the service guy even suggested i push the brakes hard to be sure they were worn enough before i ran out of warranty the clutch on the other hand is not covered by the drivetrain warranty and it was over  out of pocket if you buy this car be ready to come outofpocket deep and often
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,brakes are bad the brakes on this car are a real big problem  you will need to change them every  miles  in fact there is a class action suit by owners in the states   stay away buy a lexus
INFINITI,Price/Value,has lived up to billing this is a  month review of my  ivory g sdn which i bought as a new leftover as such it was k under sticker with   a deal which made ownership possible for an average guy it has been totally reliable in its k history one small electronic problemfrozen audio board which dealer replaced under warranty brakes and tires replaced at k by independent shop which saved of cost had regular brakes put in which i like the feel of cost half and did away with excessive brake dust issue had some trouble in one bad snowstorm last year but generally handles weather well rwd as i go skiing with it and ski tunnel is appreciated i average about mpg with mostly hwy
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,still does it for me okay its been  yrs now and still with a decent wash she my  dr g appeals to me there are newer models and even slicker looking bmws and lexus models sad they stepped up their game due to the g  but my girl holds her ownthe ride has always been a little rough considering the poor condition of las streets but on the highway and smoother roads infiniti proves its worth i made the mistake of buying without a gps but when im lost  i still enjoy the drive brakes are still an issue but survivable and the local dealers always take of you like you wer a new customer the engine now complemented with borla exhaust and cold air intake pushs about  more horse out  bhp
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,infinity   sport
INFINITI,Engine/Performance, gx i am writing this review after  months of driving i love the car and did a bunch of shopping prior to my purchase i live in mn so an awd or fwd vehicle was a must i test drove the following vehicles prior to my choice of the gx honda accord coupe nissan maxima lexus is awd lexus es and nissan altima the g was a combination of all the vehicles and really offers the power and luxury which could not be surpassed by any of the aforementioned vehicles  i drive in minneapolis rush hour daily and the snow mode comes in quite handy when the weather takes a turn for the worst i constantly try to lose control in this vehicle on secluded country roads and its almost impossible
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,defective gs this gs with summer tires would not survive in a snow storm  im battling with nissan with a suspension steering or tracking problem as this car is way too sensitive to road crown compared to every car ive driven it drives straight in the right lane but would crash into the woods next to the left lane as soon as the hands are off the steering wheel after alignment done on it  times nissan is refusing to acknowledge this quality defect while all  of their loaner cars ive driven drove without this problem i would trade it in for an awd especially living in the ne a rwd just wont cut it in snow  its worse than a maxima se dont waste your money
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,trash car i bought this car seven months ago with k miles in seven months i have spent about  in this car i had to replace tie rods drive belts automatic transmission engine mounts rotorsleaks muffler resonator etc this car is a piece of trash
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,p primera the g is a very quiet car and stable
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,one of the worst cars i ever owned i find it surprising that the last reviewer decided to keep their  instead of trade it for something better i on the other hand would have driven this heap of garbage into the junkyard had i known what a terrible car it was i even read reviews on here for months before i decided to buy one from a neighbor who obviously heard about my disappointmentsfrom the moment i started driving it lights starting come on first it was the speed sensor then the abs then the car started shaking at  miles an hour the ball joints were complete crap and the entire alignment went off within a month
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,wouldnt get this car again ok when i first got this car it had k miles on it and as soon as i hit k everything started to go bad first my fuses blew then at k i needed a new timing belt k my alternator needed to be replaced k i needed a new starter distributor cap and spark plugs when i get it back from the mechanic the radiator went bad and almost blew me engine i couldnt even pull into a driveway that sits a little up with out it messing up me bumper
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,"reliable g bought this car brand new and still have it  years later with  miles car has been extremely reliable and it is driven for a sales position that requires lots of weekly miles just kept up with regular maintenance only thing that bothered me consistently was the poor placement of cup holdeers"
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,g forever we bought this car in  as for its style comfort economy and reliability  its now seven years and ks later and it still feels and drives like a new car  im astounded at how tight and rattlefree the driving experience still is we have repaired o sensors and wiper arms under warranty changed tires and brake pads replaced the power antenna and changed a couple of  light bulbs  that is all and the car drives like new  i am not kidding  the original re bridgestone tires were awful in snow and ice but lasted k until they were taken off and thrown as far away as possible  this car should never have come with those tires as standard equipment
INFINITI,Price/Value,bang for the buck a lot of bang for the buck they should
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,luxury with sporty performance i rated the car based on the fact that it has the sport package which has sport tuned suspension larger brakes  wheels with low profile tires
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,a  mistake i purchased this car in june of  and it has been nothing but a problem from the day i got it what is wrong with the car pulls violently to the left and right when making lane changes at speeds of  mph plus hesitates or bucks at cruising speeds pulls left and right when applying breaks navigation system is off by miles heated steering wheel gets hot to the point where you cant hold it location of heated steering wheel switch is dangerous  have to take your eyes off the road and bend over to turn on or off the ride in not smooth its loud using same fob all the time but sit is always in a different position went i unlock and start car had to have battery replaced  weeks after purchase in snow it handle lit crap even in snow mode it slide all over the road to the point where i stopped driving it when it snows the dealer where i purchased the car said there is nothing wrong with it and told me its due to road conditions that is bs this car is not the high end luxury sedan that i was told it was the car is horrible and the dealers way of taken car of it was to send me a  gift card
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,problems if you want more problems than you update car is worse than in beginning on rd set of tires at k miles and all original problems still theresince the time i started this car for the first time at the dealer it has had nothing but problems first when the ac is on the car sounds like a jumbo jet trying to take off but cant you can even hear it over the radio and guests always ask me whats wrong with your car the service department told me they cant fix it because they all make this noise and infiniti knows it next the car grabs every rut in the road and flies all over the place and when i say flies i mean way beyond a safety concern the problem even gets worse when braking also there is a buzz noise when driving the car that you can hear over the radio but the dealer says they cant hear it and they cant fix it i could go on and on about how bad this car is but to tell you the truth i have already waste so much of my time on trying to get this car fix and trying to get infiniti the car company to do something about it which they wont  they have told me this one  different occasions i just cant stand this car anymore if you want all the problem you can handle and then some please buy one of these cars i thought this was going to be a great fast and cool car but all it turned out to be was a huge waste of my time and money sincerely a  time new infiniti buyer and owner also a disgusted customer of infiniti update at  miles worst car i have ever purchased all of the problems have persisted ac whines louder than i can turn the radio uo to cover it up brakes start shaking every  miles and it is not because i ride the brakes tires wear out at  miles just a terrible terrible experience with a brand new luxury car nissan north americainfiniti has refused to do anything about the concerns i have i only thing i have to look forward to is the day i trade this car in which is quickly approachingupdate at  miles all problems at still happening and infiniti hasnt contacted me to resolve any of them worst car ever
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,dream car have wanted a convertible for a long time and the combination of hardtop and convertible cannot be beaten
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,qx  the only problem i see with my qx is the wobbly handling when hitting a bump
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,problems with this truck the rotors were warped thin no good for vehicle wt   dealer trips before they replaced it manuf defect in all  y not issue recall the steering never returns  position the flaps on the back of nd row wont stay anymore velcro wore out after  mo cumbersome mech  fold nd row doesnt always work lukewarm not heated front seats very poor quality build rear door auto lift problem  tires wore out at kcheap space behind rd seat not useful like expedition oil change at nondealer and screen reminder never goes away  tire pressure gauge and hand break fault  dealer had  fix  manuf defect  one tire leaked air from valve made in japan not true luxury vehicle
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,death ride piece of junk brake judder with brake replacement plus brake failure times  dealer unable to fix requires two trips to have anything fixed replaced door lock relay and windshield washer motor recalled for fire hazard from trailer light socket dealer refuses to fix rear window spray nozzle luckily able to avoid  crashes when brakes failed shakes rattles and rolls drives like a tank steering wheel will not come back into place every time ac controls are terrible gas guzzler
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,bad infinity qx  this is without a doubt the worst vehicle that i have ever owned  i am  and trade every  years  i traded out of a lexus lx into the infiniti qx  in the first  miles the brakes failed  times  the rotors replaced  resurfaced  times  the abs and skid control malfunction almost killing me  it is a noisy rough piece of junk  traded it today for an  escalade  what a relief  the cadillac is far superior in ride quality and technology  not to mention fuel economy  the weird noises parts falling off and brake failures on the qx are almost laughable  a true garbage truck
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,still cant find what im looking for after a disappointing escalade ownership experience gave the japanese mfrs a try the qx won us over with their features gizmos and inventive seats the test drive did not reveal some immediate issues we discovered on our fist trip the truck rides hard even on highway had to reduce tire pressure to make it acceptable the road disturbances excite the truck body which resonates the interior with an uncomfortable sound shoulda used thicker steel the overhead console rattled had replaced the brakes replaced  times  never admitted that they undersized the rotors temp controls are counterintuitive seats are flat w little side  head support  nissan armadas are better
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,love it except brakes and vibration my family loves this suv  it is very comfortable and it is very fun to drive  however i just wanted to add to every person that has already said something about the brakes  we have also had the brakes serviced several times for rotor problems shaking  its very annoying because our dealership is one hour away and they wont pick up the vehicle to service it  its hard to love a car so much and have such a terrible time with the brakes  we are considering exercising the lemon law because brakes are a safety issue  maybe infiniti will perk up then  the vibration in the roof is awful too  i noticed several people are experiencing that as well
INFINITI,Design/Style,unreliable car multiple problems this car has been very disappointing  innumerable services required for multiple flaws the major one being faulty design flaw for brakes requiring service every  months as well as repairs for the rear hatch sunroof navigation system backup camera and rattling dvd console have had car  months and in for service  times  multiple complaints with this car are common esp re brakes so beware like the size it affords for a family but it has been an incredible inconvenience research the internet on the problems with this vehicle and consider waiting to purchase until the manufacturer has worked out the kinks  also beware our average is  mpg
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,"needs improvement beautiful car poor performance  the vehicle has terrible vibration in the roof  since my purchase in june  i have had several problems such as brakes seats handling vibration dvd and back hatch  dont waste your money  infiniti clearly needs to work on the quality if they are going to compete in the luxury suv market  i want to get rid of mine but wouldnt want some other poor sucker get it"
INFINITI,Price/Value,suv king compare the prices around the others
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,none the car is refined and a dream to drive
INFINITI,Price/Value,"what a piece of junk off the lot the driver side sun visor was damaged the cruise control didnt work and after one week the navigation system broke ergonomically all the controls are deficient this suv is an incredible disappointment for its price"
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,"not a very happy camper i have a little over  miles on my qx and am having a very difficult time getting some problems taken care of  i have now had it back to the dealer twice trying to get a horrible rattle stopped  my wife just had it to the dealer today its a  hour round trip and reports that she had gone less than  miles and it started again  the person in the service department went so far as to tell her hopefully it might be stopped but i cant say for sure  this is rediculous to have a  vehicle with rattles to begin with and worse that they cant seem to get them stopped  consumer affairs will hear from me tomorrow"
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,"good looking but poor quality while i enjoy the spaciousness of the qx i am very disappointed in the overall quality of the vehicle as a former lexus owner i was looking for a quality slightly larger suv the qx fit the bill in size but the qualitystops me cold in  months my catalytic converter has gone bad  there is a major squeak in the front passenger seat the problem is that no one can tell me when the part will arrive even though it was ordered at the highest customer service level ie off road in the meantime my vehicle sounds like a tankinside and out i expected better quality  service in a vehicle of this price range in my opinion infiniti has failed"
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,"qx  new buyer had initial quality problems after getting the car  replacement of map bezel  steering wheel does not extend every time i get in the car and put key in ignition  dealer is unable to find problem so i have to live with it  radio antenna on rear window was broken  if you hold the cruise control lever up for a couple seconds the car lags and then a few seconds later races from  to  before it can be stopped  dealer says they are aware of this and can do nothing about it  i like the performance handling power and comfort very much  i had  lexus before this and the service just is not up to par with what i am used to  hope they improve"
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,"what a disappointment we have owned this car for   months and it has been in service  days   tires needed replacing navigation system doesnt work paint came off front bumper when washing with a cloth wood panel fell out of side door drivers electric motor in window didnt workthe service dept has been awesome but infiniti wont stand behind the quality or lack there of of their vehicles  we paid k extra to go with the infiniti qx instead of nissan armada because of the quality issues we read in the consumer reviews  at least infiniti has provided us with a car while ours has been in service  issues with the car still remain"
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,bad dash not a great dash it will crack
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,watch out for mice leased qx in june  had continental tires on it and ride was noisey and rough all the doors rattled and windows did the same all the door hinges  strikers misaligned and had to be realigned gas mileage  in city  on highway but expected interior exceptional but nav is awful two voices and one you cant hardly understand this is a  month lease with  mirecently just after starting vehicle the wd slip vdc and abs idiot lights came on took vehicle to dealer and their findings indicated that the sensor had an open circuit they found wiring harness damage to the lf sensor they claim wires were eaten by a mouse wire covered with a plastic cable want  to fix
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,regret buying qx every day worst mistake ive ever made ive had problems with this vehicle the first  hrs i had it once vehicle was bought infiniti customer service vanished car was brand new and had many scratches and flaws dvd player broke differentials went bad within  months rust on vehicle key fobs work some days and some days not this car has paint chips everywhere a bug hits the car and the paint chips this car has new squeaks and rattles every day interior is very plasticy and is put together poorly  none of the plastic lines up leather is falling off of door infinity just keeps gluing it and wont fix it i could not be any more disappointed in a company
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,i would never buy infiniti again coming from reliable toyota vehicles i never thought that buying a new luxury vehicle would be such a let down i have had over  issues with my qx from small trim pieces falling off to the brake rotors being replaced twice the abs system failing transmission lines being replaced i just picked it up yesterday for the transmission issue  today it is still gushing fluid i am unable to park in the garage because of it this is the worst vehicle i have owned ever please reconsider your infiniti purchasesbuyer beware
INFINITI,Design/Style,still like it could not believe my wife still wanted this vehicle after the  we rented with the terrible brakes and all the bad reviews we read a year and a half later  so far so great  we really like this suv there is a little more rattling than we care for looking forward to getting the next redesigned model with all the bugs worked out
INFINITI,Price/Value,infiniti worst thing with the car is the truck like noisesalso bad cheap trim
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,problems with qx the road performance is fine  the shortfall lies in the dash poor heating and defroster times too complicated to find proper settings for climate controls  have had several minor breakdowns with basic functions ie windshield wipersmirror motors probably would not buy again im a x infinity buyer
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,stranded again my car is stuck in park again first time service mgr said it was a bad shifter nd time my cell phone charger was blamed for blowing the fuse leaving me stranded in a parking lot at night this is the third time ive been stranded my cell phone charger was not even in the car it is beginning to rattle too i wish id never traded my lexus
INFINITI,Price/Value,disappointed i own a chevy and a mecedes benz when i bought the qx i thought i would be treated with the same intensity as i am with the benz instead i feel like i bought a chevy the truck although pricey is a terrible driving truck its balloon tires bounce down the road and the steering wheel jumps out of my hand over rougher road surfaces its dashboard is the most cumbersome i have ever come across it is noisy and has many rattles it only has  miles i had problems with the front brakes at  miles the dealer knew about it the rotars were warped they cut them instead of replacing a chevy dealer would cut a benz dealer would replace
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,rattle box with bad brakes this car has been a real disappointment  we love the look of the car and the overall comfort of the interior  but we have had it in for service  times now they charge us almost  each time for service and with  miles they have had to fix the brakes  times the dealer has even admitted that there is a brake problem with these cars and they do not know how to fix it except to keep replacing them every  miles or so  the interior console that houses the fold up tv screen rattles like crazy the automatic opening backdoor has had to been fixed twice after having this car for  years i have had enough i dont feel safe with these brakes and a  month child dont buy it
INFINITI,Price/Value,dont buy a qx i bought my qx  and it has been in the shop  times for rattling from the headliner  times for brake repairs and i only have k miles on this thing the dealership is worthless and i am frustrated its not fun driving a car that has the most awful squeakrattle coming from above constantly  even my  small kids and the radio cant drown out that noise it has also been in for the gear shifter sticking twice  please think twice about this vehicleits not worth it
INFINITI,Price/Value,nothing but problems we have had nothing but problems with this car brakes have been replaced  times already cruise has never worked front window gets stuck continuely dvd replaced twice and the car is now beginning to rattle at various spots we are trying to use the lemon law to get our money back
INFINITI,Price/Value,thumbs down door handles break when cold hard to use windows low mileage per gallon must get filled about every three days cost about  to filltakes super can only see front hood very little like a minivan moon roof is very noisy tires do not retain air reverse camera distracts you from looking back when backing up and it does not show everything behind you takes long time before car heats up poor handleing however its navigation system is exceptional
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,rattlesuv the car has had enough rattles for  auto  it has been in service at least every month working on the rattle and front wheel rattle  would never purchase another infiniti again after this experience
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,handles like a much smaller vehicle had zero problems with the vehicle  there was a recall that required the vehicle be in the shop for a few days but they gave us a loaner new vehicle same type
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,qx timing chain recall and cat failure  qx have issues with the timing chain  there is a recall on the timing chain which if you are thinking of buying a used qx you will want to make sure this recall has been done  we had ours done at k  the timing chain issue can cause the engine to  fail if not accomplished  engine runs inefficiently which fouls clogs the catalytic converters  catalytic converters if not replaced will fail early to the tune of  each for replacement  the gas mileage is overstated there is no way the qx will get mpg on highway  i believe the newer qxs have the epa sticker corrected  my advise would be to skip the infinity and buy a tesla model x or a loaded chevy tahoe
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,infiniti consumer affairs with  miles airbag sensors needed to be replaced in passenger seat  horn honks at random times  called infiniti consumer affairs and have been put through the ringer  obviously an electrical glitch somewhere vehicle has been in the shop for  weeks  very disappointed with infinitis support on a  vehicle  buyer beware
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,bad steering  qx  miles  trips to service very very bad steering cant seem to fix great interior nice power vibrations horrible wife and i have each had a new vehicle each yr for  plus yrs  other infiniti this one is nice inside and tough to drive on highway because of loose steer bad shakes vibration in steering column and floors very bad paint has orange peel all over unit needs buyback service staff nice infiniti rep young and has no clue
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,big disappointment i just turned in my  armada got the  qx looking forward to a great sound system with all my music on the hardrive alas i did not research it enough because i couldnt find any info it hardrive can only be loaded by recording cds to ittakes forever i have no cds anymorethe compact flash medium is illconceivedjunk infiniti sales people must have been told to play dumb because none of them acknowledge what a limited feature this is single cd player only none of this info anywhere on website or marketing materials  i would not pay an extra nickel for it buy the armada and dont option it i had brake issues on the  i hope that is done with
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,nice cruiser but terrible transmission i traded an  passat for my g three months ago so far really like the car except for a couple of complaints the transmission jolts the car when shifting gears most of the time and the quick shift is useless  hesitates when changing gears and then its like it cant decide which gear to settle into when downshifting  very annoying and disappointing  also cruise control revs the engine suddenly when using the accelerate feature personally dont care about the poor gas mileage  its not that bad and i wasnt expecting too much with this much power
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,nd infiniti this is my second infiniti  my last vehicle was a cayenne however i wanted to shed myself of an suv while maintaining the versatility of awd  i decided on the gx coupe based on the reliability and performance factor of my previously owned infiniti fx   my fx never and i mean never went back to the dealership  i had the oil changed every  miles at my local service station  i test drove the bmw x and could not justify spending the difference in price for a comparable car  the g coupe is comfortable handles well and has insane acceleration  the standard feature list far surpasses any of its competitors from germany  i would definitely buy it again
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,germans do it better i am at  miles on my g and cant wait to get rid of it worst transmission ive ever driven  the car lurches forward on downshifts sometimes it hesitates rendering manual and ds positions useless even passengers notice the sloppy shift pattern in automatic when i took it back to the dealer to repair the tranny he told me its the way its supposed to shift youre not driving a lexus hmm do yourself a favor and get a german car or hey how about a lexus
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,fuel consumption terrible i have had the car for  week fuel consumption is not good at all i am looking at around  miles to the gallon have driven  miles and used  gallons this includes a majority of hwy   and   city my chevy tahoe gave me  to a full  gallon gas tank i was told that it would give me  city and  hwy it is such an expensive car and i will definitely not buy an infinity again very displeased the car is definitely not worth the money not much to celebrate for the price payed
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,test drove dont own coming from  bmw m smg and  audi a speed giac chipped gs felt slow maybe just a bit faster then my a again giac chipped and much slower then m steering not as tight as on previous cars at k miles there was a lot of not normal wear on plastics and leather the built quality inside is on par with honda civic i am sorry i wanted to like this car but i thats usually compared to gs is just a better car all around
INFINITI,Design/Style,mid life crisis car did  a lot of homework before purchasing this car  the car for the  quality design reliability and price has no competition
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,nice car but minor problems get to me little annoying things go wrong
INFINITI,Price/Value," fx just leased one of the remaining s w luxury package for mo months w  down  for the past two and a half years i have been driving my wifes old rx which i inherited after we had a second kid and bought a mini van  the fx  will never be mistaken for a mini van  this car is an absolute beast that begs to be driven it appears that with the release of the s s can be had for at or under invoice my cap cost was  below invoice"
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,smokin what a fun surprise to get behind the
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,the fx  the car is very tough  fun to ride
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,"crossover reliability this was my first experience with an infiniti unfortunately my experience has been a bit disappointing i have had numerous issues i first discovered that the hatchback cover in the heatwould warp or melt i was forced to wait for several months while infiniti decided what to do during this time i could not use the hatchback at all the most recent issue is that the drivers seat actually squeaks and gps screen which controls the entire interior functionality of the vehicle has failed bottom line  i spend more time out of the vehicle than on the road"
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,interior designation that the dashboard will get pimpled and leather seats cracked we also had engine problems
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,"they cant find the noise its been in the shop for about  days and they still can not find the noise its so aggravating to drive a  car and not enjoy it because of the noise"
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,could never trade it in it is the liquid cooper with brickblack leather tech package  regular servicing has been all that has been needed other than a couple manufacturer covered recalls   i went to trade it in a few times and could never bring myself to do it  it is a blast to drive and has been reliable  have had it since new in
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,really unsatisfied this car has had more problems than i could count the rear hatch had a plastic strip detach and bend my roof theres a recall for this the engine knocks when cold theres a recall for this the dealer still hasnt fixed it after  tries the tires keep losing pressure and then theres an annoying beep dealer says that comes with the terriorty of having tire pressure sensors the most serious problem the steering wheel knocks when turning to the leftthe dealer changed the rack  pinion on it  times thats a serious mechanical problem and the same problem keeps coming backyou would think this car is a lemon but no the dealer says its not im stuck with a car thats not worth the price
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,good stuff bad stuffall sorts of stuff have had the car  yrs i drive it hard and in hot weather in southern fl and it always handles well factory goodyears are no good causes car to shift all over the lane some what typical with wide tires and very unnerving at mph try nittos fuzion toyo etcand the problem is resolved been through  sets of tires always extra power on tap but engine is very sensitive to bad gas from stations by the beach several instances of failure to downshift inf of cc ran all tests and nothing was found to be wrong another time must have got bad gas again and truck could not catch up to a punk in an acura and it topped out at   it will do about  before electro nanny says stop
INFINITI,Design/Style,nothing but problems from the first week  transfer case seal oil leak x  moon roof leak x  electronic door malfunctions  cd player quit working x caught on fire once  the tires wear out in  miles  dont expect a winter vehicle unless you buy smaller wheels and snow tires  the wide tires look cool but on conventional roads they shift the car slightly back and forth my wife wont take long trips in it because it makes her car sick  in every instance it took multiple attempts to fix the problems at the dealership it wasted countless hours that i didnt have  i had to show the mechanic myself where the drip from the transfer case seal was problems for only
INFINITI,Engine/Performance," year later  year k miles so far replace rear hatch due to warping bad adhesive in early models replace ac compressor noise replace  catalytic convertors bad batch manufactured seat leather wrinkled and deformed on side bolsters  most recent  replaced engine certain vs showing excess oil usage in a number of enginesring problems not worth the hassles"
INFINITI,Design/Style,the radio sucks  i am not very happy with my new car
INFINITI,Engine/Performance," month update i have owned my fx for six months i now feel more qualified to rate it i am pleased with its performance and style i am not happy with the dealership that i purchased the car from in my opinion they are dishonest  of poor character basically they lack the integrity that i would expect from a luxury car dealer and to top that their service is terrible i would suggest that one would check a dealership out before commiting to a purchase i bought mine in orange county ca dealership name witheld they know who they are"
INFINITI,Design/Style,look out when i was making my decision between
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,"bucket of bolts the fx is one hot car unfortunately ive discovered mine to be a bucket of bolts at k miles it was in to the shop for numerous rattles and i am now returning about every  weeks for additional rattles inside the doors rear hatch and in the dashboard i ahve a  ford explorer with k miles and its as tight as the day that i bought it  no rattles or squeks and i cant figure out why a k infiniti with less than k miles rattles excessively id think twice about buying the fx"

INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,dont buy these cars my car was  years old and got  smaller rust spots that bubbled the paint then came through it had a very large rust spot on  the door i took it to the dealer to have it covered under the warranty after i couldnt reach anyone they blew me off till the warranty expired and acted like they didnt know i brought the car in even though i had their info and business card finally i went on social media and got an instant response i took the car back in and now they say that the rust was caused by the roads how does it bubble from under the paint then come thru if it was a chip infiniti just lost a customer for life and to think i was going to buy another one now the car is worthless just like their warranty
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance, g infiniti purchase upgraded from  i
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,why does this car not hold its value i have had no problems with my car  i think it is a very eyecatching vehicle with very nice interior appointments  my only complaint is the size of the truck which is due to the positioning of the gas tank  this definitely should have been changed before   why does this vehicle lose its value so precipitously  i am considering purchasing the car when the lease expires but am afraid it is one of the worst automobile investments i can make

INFINITI,Engine/Performance,exellent performance exellent car with a lot of room for a
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,aint for everybody ive owned the fx for a couple months there are few on the street with most of the brand being fxs the car does demand respect in traffic as it seems those who know tend to shy away from it this car is fast brings us to next point this is not a truck should not be considered an suvcuv either i wanted a sports car but had trouble giving up the suv height and utility that is exactly what you get with this model an suv sports car if you are looking for off road capability and storage forget the fx if getting a little not a lot of attention and v power is your thing you wont be disappointed true competition is the cayenne s and bmw x  both are k more
INFINITI,Engine/Performance, fxs issues i purchased this vehicle with sport and tech pkgs in august of  and was struck with its styling and v engine hpimmediately i noticed that when accelerating from a slow rollthere was a slight hesitation then a jerk as the transmission engagedi took the car in several times but nothing could be foundthe dealer finally told me that there was a tech bulletin on the issue but no solutionso i still live with that about a  yrs ago my bluetooth started dropping out or not hooking up a real irritation since i use my car for businessi took it in and was told that there is a problem with iphone bluetooth and the cari am not happy with the lack of resolutions
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,totally not worth the money paid navigation system interface is very unattractive and not very userfriendly fuel economy is a foreign concept to fx the ride is bumpy and uncomfortable there is no offroad capability the worst aspect of ownership is having to deal with infiniti the service is very poor they dont even provide loaner cars when needed infiniti customer service proved useless at this point i would go with lexus supposedly their customer service is unparalleled i strongly advise against infiniti as a brand
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior, it update  now im on my th set of rotorscalipers terrible investment and ill never buy another nissaninifinitiupdate   terrible investmentupdate   im on my th set of rotors and calipers they are junk this car goes through rotors and calipers in  years ill never buy another nissaninfinitivery good looking car i purchased it newwe noticed that the car does not handle well when you go into a turn it feels like the front tires are beginning to slide i purposely drove it into a corner unusually fast  plenty of recovery space and the car does slide badlyi took it back to the dealership and they said it was perfect well if thats perfect dont expect me to purchase another infinitiwe have replaced the brakes including calipers and rotors numerous times calipers freeze up often it will stop on a dime but having to replace the brakes every  to  miles is beyond excessiveill never purchase another infinitinissan
INFINITI,Design/Style,nice  car but bad reliability i bought this car about a year ago with k miles on it and have had problems ever since  upon purchase i had to replace the belts which is to be expected for a  year old car what i didnt expect was the catalytic converter to fail which infiniti covers up to k miles the ac compressor to fail all  coils needed to be replaced the muffler was banging the bottom of the car and the cd player stopped working  at this point about  has been spent on repairs luckily we bought an extended warranty  my other car is a nissan altima and i really like it but i doubt ill be buying another infiniti
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,you will spend oh yes traded in an older camry for the infiniti because my wife thought it was ugly  however in  years i spent less on that car then ive spent in the past  months on the i  had it checked out before we bought it all systems were a go  however within  months the alternator went out  shortly after that the car started misfiring and it started running poorly and jerking when at a stop light  had the engine coils replaced along with the spark plugs and a full maintenance check  fluids flush  also have had to replace both rear and front brakes  so  months and at least  later hopefully we are done for awhile with spending money on it
INFINITI,Design/Style,safety first bought the car slightly used about k miles and it has performed very well  unfortunately it was totaled this month in a roll over front end crash and i walked away with a few cuts but fully intact  car appealed to me for dependability  body style slightly boring sedan  loved auto seats and stereo system though in dash  disc changer would be preferable
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,what a mistake  i miss my tahoe i was forced to trade a tahoe lt to get something with better economy  i have a sizable commute thru baltimore it started out ok but slowly deteriorated to become a vehicle i cant wait to get rid off no more infinitis for me  evertheres this clicking noise in the climate control  fan at lowest setting  after i got this car i found out infinity fixed it nope ill never be suckered into a premium japanese auto again  unless its a lexus

INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,infiniti  i have owned this vehicle for  years
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,ill buy another i dont want a lot of hassel  service
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,thinking twice about infiniti  bought this car after my sc was totaled had about k on it or so performance is decent but coming from a rwd v to a fwd v was a little disappointing dont get me wrong i love my i but its conditional love this car has been an absolute nightmare the vss was replaced twice maf sensor is prone to replacement ecm burned up due to sudden fault in the idle control suspension is very soft even for a sedan besides this long list of expensive i mean very expensive repairs i enjoy driving this car it has a very responsive throttle and gets attention where ever it goes
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,mechanical nightmare bought the car in  from team nissan in oxnard ca they failed to inform me car had been in an accident hood didnt have vin etc put k on it in four years but didnt have it running for  months of that replaced wheel bearings two new alternators vss sensor starter ignition radiator fine when you punch it but very heavy otherwise  altima v tromps this car with offline and duringdriving quicknessbut with only  more hp i like the exterior and interior but leather seats cracking clock wand rattles wind noise from back window paint fading horribly wanted an infiniti from day one only enjoyed it for a year then it became a  black hole f you team infiniti
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,worst car i ever owened my wifes honda accord was stolen and we wanted a a nice temporary replacement car for her while we recuperated from the loss buying a used infiniti i was a huge mistake within one week of taking it home the instrument panel went out  towing  to repair after that it has left us stranded  times at  per tow replaced alternator starter belts and oxygen sensors lately its its been stalling and dealer says we need a new transmission probably another  in repairs we bought the car for  with the intention of keeping it for one year and so far weve spent  in repairs we should have just bought something new
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,"hated it from day  brake problems stalling out problems transmission problems  alternators lemon lemon lemon"
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,"uncomfortable nice car but very uncomfortable on long drives  cannot adjust seating to maintain comfort  im not an old guy either"
INFINITI,Price/Value,dont do it i bought this car  months ago it has
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,wind noise the wind noise has been so bad we cancelled our summer trip to north carolina  eight trips to the dealer telephoned to california  after a year of frustration i was told  we do not make that model any more sorry i am paying off the  month lease for  and selling it to local dealer for  anyone else had this sad experience
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,infinity is made out of tin can just dont buy it ill bring my sandwich to stay with you to persuade not to buy the car almost everything is cheaply designed constructed and inconveniently structured technology is one or two step behind the command system responds one half to one second later the compartment is tied together with a string you have to use your finger nails to pull out gas lid no pop up
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,if they only updated a few things this has surprisingly been a fun car to drive my biggest disappointment is that i do mostly city driving and the gas mileage is very disappointing  it dramatically improves if youre doing hwy driving  the legroom in the back is laughable  thankfully i rarely had riders  my only other complaint is the microphone and sound quality for cellular calls was spotty  lastly inifiti has only made one minor update to the car in nearly a decade  whats the deal with that
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,poor support from nissa dealer as infiniti dealer make sur you have viable dealer that will be in business as nissan dealer treats me like s
INFINITI,Price/Value,not fully satisfied if you live in a snowy climate be prepared to have the front and back sensors go off the entire time you are driving because the snow builds up on it when i called to ask about it i was told i could either turn the sensors off manually and lose the safety feature or keep getting out of my car to wipe them off thats not an option as i drive mainly on highways and will not pull off on an interstate highway and risk getting hit     not acceptable for the cost of this car                                                                   i also put in an after market remote starter which will not work as i was told by the dealer after i put it in that the heater etc will reset to automatic and theres nothing i can do about it that should have been told to me when i told the dealer i was putting a remote starter in since they said they couldnt do it after market at the dealership                              the other thing i am struggling with is i do not hear my email tones on my phone or thru the car  ive called a number of times and the blue tooth department tells me its an in touch problem and in touch says its blue tooth department  meanwhile i know it works because ive heard it a couple times but its not consistent  so frustrating                                                      im hoping someone can help as i have  years left on my lease
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,the dealership makes a big difference the dealership made the difference
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,beware bought a new  red sport two days after purchase the lower touch screen malfunctions took it back to the dealer and was told i need a new dcu the lower screen i was told it would take  days on the th day i had to call to find out whats going on and was told the part is on back order for a month as of today the month has come and gone and still no car and no idea when i would get it back inifiniti customer care has to be the worst in history i have been lied to and my calls have gone unanswered they tell me dates then when the date passes i have to call and then im told another date with no explanation as to why the change ive searched the internet and found that the dcu is an on going issue for infiniti since  so they know about it but when i originally asked if this is something that happens alot i was told no this has been my worst purchase ever the look  power and handling of the car is fantastic but the unreliability of the electronics and the terrible customer service makes this a bad buy i gave up a reliable lexus i had for  years for this car and it broke in  days this is my first and last infiniti after i get it back i need to find a way to get out of it before anything else happens
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,the least reliable luxury sedan poor quality ever dont buy it is the least reliable luxury cars on sale today ive had  q hybrid for almost  years i have been having many issues with the cars the steering system handling navigation touchscreens keyless entry and bluetooth  today i had to bring my car back to the dealership again for das repair the car started going to right by itself and started  braking itself causing the risks of crashes i am done with infiniti
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,unpredictable  i traded in my  accord  cyl with the q hybrid i regret for my decision the acceleration is uneven especially at lower speed and in the city the transition from hybrid to gasoline is abrupt and feel embarrassed because even the passengers can feel it and questioned if theres anything wrong with the car the acceleration is unpredictable at lower speed and there were many times i felt the car lunge forward when i only step on the pedal just a little and other times i had to step on it hard before it will take off after driving for  miles i felt the car a lot heavier than the accord and the handling is not that much better which i expected more from a rwd
INFINITI,Design/Style,very disappointing i was one of the first buyers of the q at the end of  and i bought it because i wanted a sedan and loved the styling there are several problems with the q but first the things i like i definitely have felt safe in the car despite having to have it towed only once because the steering started to click it couldnt seem to find its feet this only happened once and infiniti fixed it and paid for the tow its a solid car however it rides rough its noisey and the worst part is that displaynavigation is very unresponsive its incredibly annoying to push on the screen and taking as long as  seconds to accept the response ive had the car now for   years and infiniti has yet to correct this whoever designed where the usb port was put must have been a contortionist because its almost useless the navigation is stupid and not at all intuitive additionally for the life of me i cannot understand why i cant make ecodrive the default you always have to start in standard mode i believe the q drives better and will consider it when my lease is up but unless i were to get a screaming deal i probably would move on to another brand
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,q rocket its not a jet its a rocket
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,dont buy from infinity interior is creaks engine is lights up every months sterling wheel is give a judder when pushing break and many many other problemsand costumer service isthe worst they are dont care about you your car and they reputation
INFINITI,Price/Value,hate this car  cant wait to get rid of it i used to love the infiniti brand and my q is the forth one i have owned something has happened to infiniti reliability over the last several years and its moving in the wrong direction the worst part is that infiniti leadership doesnt seem to care this is also the opinion of numerous infiniti employees i have talked to
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,"buyers remorse this is one of the biggest mistake ever not only did oc infiniti ripped me off they sold me a lemon  first and foremost this car stinks from the ac to the dead body order coming from the sunroof  apparently there is a tsb for the smell havent taken the car in yet this will be the rd time ive taken the car to the dealership for the smell  the first  times was a waste of time  nd the car gets horrible mpgs im avg mpg city driving  the steering wheel uses remote control steering technology and it feels exactly like it sounds ever played with a remove control car from the  cent store the steering wheel control in this k car has the same feel crap"
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,not impressed i have been driving this car for a month  it has excessive wind noise engine noise and road noise  far more than expected for a car in this price range  a harsh ride too  severe torque steer as if it was a frontwheeldrive car  about  of the time it doesnt recognize that i have the key in my pocket  about  of the time it beeps a loud alarm when after i park the car and turn it off i open the door   strong engine but i am only averaging  mpg in mixed driving pretty bad in my opinion for this small car
INFINITI,Price/Value,infiniti q the worst car of  this car represents the the company as a wholefailurenot only did the stealership pull a bait and switch on me by changing the price of the car from sales to finance but their customer service after the sales was just horridgo to the q forum and you can read hundreds of owners who regret buying this car several members have successfully gotten infiniti to buy back the car das is a gimmickit doesnt work in the real worldit feels artificial and has tons of bugs the intouch unit is laggy and prematurely releasedeveryone who bought the q were unwilling beta tester for the company avoid infiniti and the qthis car sucks and so does the company
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,qs infiniti computer debacle i bought a new q sport awd in midoctoberit is fun to drive performance and handling are great the interior is well appointed and comfortable it looks and feels luxurious the major disappointment with this car is the infiniti intouch system this system is used to control the navigation climate and audio systems the system is takes a long time to first boot up and then is slow to respond to user input the worst part is that it crashes and locks up all the controls this was improved with a software upgrade but is still an issue its not fun when the navigation system gets reset while following route directions
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,infiniti q is the worst car i have been a long time infiniti owner i have owned the gx m and jxi bought the q when it first came out and has had these issues slow responsiveness of touch screen gps loosing signal and going to a blank screen electric steering locking while in drive major safety issue doors locking and not able to get into our out of the carmajor safety issuei signed a  month lease and i am stuckhopefully things continue to break so the car can fit into the lemon law and i can get rid and break this leasebased on these issues i do not recommend the infiniti qwait  years before buying it
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,run flat tires id avoid the q like the plague  ive had  flat tires in  years  cant wait for the lease to end  dealership and infiniti usa dont want to acknowledge or deal with the issue but do your research  there are enough stories like mine to educate consumers about this proble
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,new tiresbrakes before k miles have been leasing cars for about  yrs this is  my st and last infiniti not my first high end vehicle lease either but so disappointed about the quality of parts on this car  i drive normally standard wear and tear expected but to have to change my run flat tires front break pads rotors back rotors cut etc and cough up  in mid lease and less than k miles is unheard of terrible whats worse i tried to contact infiniti and complain  they put the blame on me as if my driving pattern etc but i ask if its my driving pattern  why is this the first leased car i had to maintain the way it requires  im so dissapointed because overall hoping someone would have reimbursed me etc  again with brakes i noticed something was wrong when the car would shake  the dealership told me i need new brakes  goes back in few months   going back to honda acura
INFINITI,Price/Value,the awesomist you will not be disappointed in choosing the q
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,disappointed i purchased the q over the bmw because i could get a v for the same price as the the bmw cyl  turbo  acceleration is fun but the car does not grip the road like a bmw  the handling  is squirrelly also the q makes a bizarre ping sound when backing out of a parking space  ive brought into the dealer  times and they could not fix it  they even replaced the steeiring column  also the only place to put your phone is in the center console and the the center console is too small for my iphone   its a love  hate relationship with my q
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,worst car i have ever had this is the worst car i have ever owned  and ive owned some real losers  the apps are extremely slow to load taking almost  minutes to load  the monitors often go black and will not come back on until the car is restarted   the cabin space is so very small  the cargo truck is so small that if you have a bag of groceries it will squash the items in the bag  the navigation system usually is inaccurate and shuts down within  mile of what it perceives to be the destination   there are no safety features for the price of  one would have expected at least blind spot  warning   the honda accord at    less has more features  i would never recommend this vehicle   additionally the leasing company wanted to charge me  for excess wear and tear on tires that had less than  miles on them    terrible   mileage is horrendous barely gets    mpg   not happy at all
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,beware of intrusive and unpredictable systems loved the vehicle when i purchased it brand new and loaded with every option  sporadic intrusive and dangerous behavior by the smart safety systems and direct adaptive steering das has made me afraid to drive the vehicle  i wont put my family in itthe dealership and infiniti blame all trouble on a ez pass transponder being placed too much in front of the camera on the windshield research thoroughly before purchasing this vehicle  im not the only one with problems
INFINITI,Price/Value,leased the  infiniti t luxe in march  the glowing led lights on the front grille illuminate the infiniti emblem logo  the vehicles drive assist package and other safety features provide for added value  if negotiated properly this car is a must have
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,not so luxurious i rented this vehicle on may   from hertz  the vehicle looks nice on the outside and the dimensions give an impression of large interior size    however the vehicle is small on the inside  especially the back seat leg room  the worst part is the road noise intruding into the vehicle on rough roads  the ford fusion and hyundai sonata are quieter on the inside and can be bought for thousands less  id skip this vehicle  however if your heart is set on this vehicle then make sure to test drive the car on a rough road  then test drive a ford fusion and hyundai sonata on the same road before you purchase or lease
INFINITI,Engine/Performance, infiniti jx review  k miles logged bought brand new and a short review after owning for k miles  major mechanical items engine transmission etc have been reliable  as others have noted the transmission is sluggishunderpowered constant issuerecalls with passenger side airbag and the gas mileage is horrible  we average about  mpg in the city and  highway  key concerns   replaced battery  times in  years with terminals connectors having been replaced twice  door mouldings routinely come apart making car noisy with lots of squeaks  driver and passenger visors repeatedly break  each to replace at dealer due to cheap parts  tiny driver kickplate led to hole in interior floor carpet and the dealer wanted  to repair   brakes have short lifespan k to k and need replaced dealer quotes  for front pads  outrageous    terrible dealer supportlack of warranty support  infiniti of scottsdale az is the worst  the service advisors almost appeared to be gleeful as they told us repeatedly that another issue with the vehicle was not covered under warranty during the supposed  yeark warranty period    all said this is truly not a luxury vehicle  just buy the pathfinder and save kk  or if you truly want a reliable luxury vehicle go with lexus or maybe acura   not impressed with the infiniti jx
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,sexy but uncomfortable this car is a beauty  it almost seriously drives itself  however the seats are so uncomfortable that i wont be keeping it  the position options are many i thought i could make this work  unfortunately there doesnt seem to be a right fit for me  im  average buildand disappointed
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,stranded in a disabled jx and towed twice this car is terribly unreliable  in the  years ive owned this vehicle it has been in the shop  times for repair  when you purchase a  vehicle dont expect to have transmissions problems broken fuel line  corroded battery at k mliesunless you enjoy loaner cars  repair billsdo not purchase an infiniti jx
INFINITI,Price/Value,"nonpermissible content removed i have had my  jx one month apparently before the  all new qx came out unbeknownst to any salesperson it will be  in may with k miles   sticker price with every bell and whistle  been in the shop  times  lost count i have had  new sets of remotes found car running in a pkg lot found it jamming out to heavy metal at a costco via xm radio while not running i do not use  times lift gate is open when i return  new dvd headrests trans slipping on inclines stereo flips bt radio which i hate pandora and itunes nav wants me to live in ar vs tx bluetooth repl x gas tank x all cameras reset window quit after  mo list goes on and on and on"
INFINITI,Design/Style,questionable build quality new rear brakes and rotors at k miles  new front tires at k miles no tread warranty on oem bridgestones another  trim that routinely falls off weather stripping that wont stay on as if someone forgot to glue it  underpowered  crappy cvt  i am shocked at lack of build quality  i would not buy again  i understand from consumer reports that the sistercar nissan pathfinder is also substandard
INFINITI,Design/Style,what a disappointment been fighting blown fuses since delivery five times to dealer still blowsthe dash trim is now fading wood look now has a creamy line through it and a part of the center consolelive  miles from dealer wants me to make to trips to diagnose the dash problem then come back and replace plasticcustomer relations will mentor the dealer to improve his response to customer problems this non event is turning out to be a nightmarein addition delaing with the affairs office is like dealing with terrible attitudesall this at  miles
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,do not buy this vehcile bewaredo not buy a vehicle from infiniti they are crooks i bought a  jx within the st  miles we noticed the transmission was having problems everyone at infiniti told us that we need to break in the car for  miles and that the car has a cvt transmission finally we got tired of the transmission continually jerking around and grinding between  mph and we brought it in after  days in the shop they finally said they need to replace the torque converter done after we picked up the vehicle the car was doing the same thing as before yet worse back to the dealer same day finally we are told that they need to replace the transmission totally unacceptable infiniti
INFINITI,Service/Maintenance,multiple repairs without satisfaction i purchased my car in november  within a few months i had a problem with a rattle underneath the back seatafter taking it for repair the shop informed me that they fixed the problemthe problem recurred again and this time they informed me that they had to remove the dash to fix the problemthe car has been back for repair five times for the same issue without addressing the problem successfullymy efforts to have the manufacturer buy back have been fruitlessthis car is a a disappointment and the customer service is very poorthis is not what i expected after spending so much much for a luxury carcustomer care service did a very poor job in dealing with my problem
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,poor fuel economy ive been driving the car for about  miles and i get under  mpg combined highwaycity in sport mode what is even more outrageous is that if i drive in normal or eco mode all i get is under  mpg is this other owners experience or this particular vehicle has an issue planning to take it back to dealership to check whats going onalso sometimes the satellite radio reception in poor anybody else having this issue
INFINITI,Design/Style,front grill peels has a bad problem with the front grill and couldnt they will not do anything to help
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,qx backup camera disappointment my review is negative because of the car quality not the overall company because i had a great experience with the local dealer here im very disappointed with the qx  quality of the backup camera and the  degrees cameras this is by far the worst quality of cameras in the car market it looks like a camera from  years ago the car also love gas too much im averaging  miles in the city and  in the highway i had big engine cars all my life and this car is the worst in that department you would expect when you pay over k for a car with normal backup camera thats my biggest complaint with the car  at night you cant even see anything
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,climate control issues i agree with all the other posts about climate control issues  the temp does not regulate wellits either really hot or really cold  both of my toyotas never had this problem  the issue is bad enough that im considering selling it with under k miles  overall its a nice suv and if youre tall like me you have plenty of head room with the sun roof
INFINITI,Price/Value, qx test drive
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,do not buy this suv there is a problem with all of the  qx suvs acknowledged by infiniti  the fuel sensor in the tank is located too high in the fuel tank  you cannot measure the last  gallons of a  gallon tank  after using  gallons it will put hazard lights on the dash and tell you that your tank is completely empty shen in fact you still have  gallons left  infinti has been unable to repair this problem with any of their qx vehicles from do not buy this car
INFINITI,Design/Style,poor engineering and design costly mistake dont buy this convertible unless you are ready to replace the battery every  to  months after purchasing in february  the car failed to start in december  stranding us at the local shopping mall when we took it in to have it looked at we were told that we werent driving it enough to keep the battery charged it was our intention to drive it sparingly to help maintain its value by october  the new battery had died stranding us again even though we had driven it at least  minutes every  days as instructed this time we were told that the car was engineered to only charge periodically while running so as to increase gas mileage if we wanted to keep the battery from dying we had to drive it even more or put it on a trickle charger when we werent driving it when we bought the car we werent told any of this didnt know we were buying an electric car that had to be plugged in every night
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,infiniti qx should be called mercedes qx call this car what it is a poorly built mercedes  i was involved in an accident and jumped to soon to purchase the qx  i thought i was buying infiniti so buyer beware its a mercedes throughout except for the body  even the exhaust looks like mercedes  i owned the infiniti fx for nearly  years and miss is so  i doubt that i will own this car for  months  the qx handles ok but the instrument panel is crap and not easily accessible  the cargo space is very limited and for all that money you dont even get a power lift gate  so glad the kids are out of the house as the back seat is really small  so no if your expecting traditional infiniti maybe save your money and get the qx  i should have waited and purchased something else  very disappointed
INFINITI,Price/Value,love it with a  warning after finally graduating the kids from school i decided to spend some money on myself i found my dream car in a garnet and black g sport convertible my love affair with this car was dampened by my most recent visit to the infiniti dealership to repair the icc cruise control that would not set when the service department calls and asks are you sitting down then you know you are in trouble    to fix the icc cruise control  i talked to the corporate rep and they refused to help at all even though the car has only  miles on it so i was extremely disappointed that they could care less about protecting the infiniti brand so my advice is to never purchase a new infiniti with expensive bells and whistles  look for values on the used market
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,after almost  years its almost  years since we bought our g and we have no regretsother than routine servicing its only been in for three tbs  one for transmission it worked navigation another story and the rear passenger window air leak caused wind noise at speed  correctedthe initial enthusiasm for the navigation system waned as we regularly were directed to nonexistent destinations such as restaurants in the middle of established residential areas this is a poor data issue that infiniti refused to addressthe fuel economy mainly highway has consistently amazed us  even at  mph we average
INFINITI,Engine/Performance, year lease coming to an end i have  months left to the leasei initially got this car because my wife and i both liked the design and the standard features were niceoverall the car has worked fine for uscons from day  pulling out of the dealer lot the transmission is jerksonly happens when the engine starts coldwind noisealways sounds like its coming from the rear passenger sidei keep checking to see if my son left the window openpros the engine is nice unfortunately its mated to a terrible trannywear and tear on the interior trim and leather is nicecleaned up you could hardly tell there was k on this car
INFINITI,Engine/Performance,engine blows up at  miles the timing chain broke at  miles and before i could pull over the engine was ruined  there was no signal on the dashboard that there was a problem but i could hear the valves pinging  the dealer said the only option was a new engine and offered no compensation or explanation  i changed the oil religiously with synthetic so there was no problem there the infiniti customer service was a joke  they basically said the car was out of warranty and stuff happens   my disappointment at buying a luxury car that didnt make it to  miles cant be explained  then they sent me a survey to ask about my experience i should have gone with the hyundai at least korean companies stand by their products
INFINITI,Comfort/Interior,loud brakes and horrible interior third time infiniti buyer and third time was not the charm my car has been in the shop  times in the first  months of ownership for brake noise noise loud enough to be heard inside the house when i enterexit the driveway excuse after excuse from the dealer with no real resolution first it was a pin then a hose and now a spring i have to fight to get them to reproduce every single time ive been told they squeak when theyre cold then they squeak when theyre hot and finally its not a safety issue opened a case with customer service what a joke called  times now twice spoke to the rep and twice left messages not a single thing done as a result of case opened
INFINITI,,q aka g
INFINITI,Mileage/Fuel,q  what you should know before you buy  q journey  i generally agree with the edmunds review however there are two things that i wish that id known before getting into a lease on this car which would have swayed me in another direction mpg  the awful entertainment systemive had the car a few days shy of five months and in that time im astounded at the poor gas mileagethe epa sticker estimate puts it at a combined mpg however my best efforts at driving gaswise have resulted in no better than  mpg combined   mpg is low by any standars and believe me youll start to feel the hit in your wallet when filling that tank with premium
INFINITI,Price/Value,lemon law filed lemon law and switched to cadillac ats coupe  because i cant deal with infiniti any longer
